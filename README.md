#About RPGXplorer

RPGXplorer is a character generator for the d20 Open Gaming License system.

The application was originally developed by Anurien and Asmodai of PierceMorgan, Ltd. As such, PierceMorgan, Ltd. retains the rights to the RPGXplorer brand name and iconography. Development was handled by the group from 2005 through 2009 before a number of outside factors (time, money, personal matters, and the like) brought its development to a halt.

The application has now been made open source in hopes that the community can keep the project alive.
