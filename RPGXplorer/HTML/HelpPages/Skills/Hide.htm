					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;: Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of 
					anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and 
					hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than 
					your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It's practically impossible (-20 
					penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.<br>
      <br>

					A creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide 
					checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small 
					+4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.<br>
      <br>

					You need cover or concealment in order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or 
					total concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the 
					need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.<br>
      <br>

					If people are observing you, even casually, you can't hide. You can run around 
					a corner or behind cover so that you're out of sight and then hide, but the 
					others then know at least where you went.<br>
      <br>

					If your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff check; see 
					below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention 
					from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some 
					kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per 
					rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because 
					you have to move fast.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Sniping:</i> If you've already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from 
					your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You 
					take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</i> You can use Bluff to help you hide. A 
					successful Bluff check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt 
					a Hide check while people are aware of you.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Usually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as 
					part of movement, so it doesn't take a separate action. However, hiding 
					immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a move action.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;If you are invisible, you gain a +40 bonus on 
					Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you're 
					moving.<br>
      <br>

					If you have the Stealthy feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.<br>
      <br>

					A 13th-level ranger can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, 
					even if it doesn't grant cover or concealment. A 17th-level ranger can do this 
					even while being observed.<br>
