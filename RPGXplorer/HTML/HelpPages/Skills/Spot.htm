					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;The Spot skill is used primarily to detect 
					characters or creatures who are hiding. Typically, your Spot check is opposed 
					by the Hide check of the creature trying not to be seen. Sometimes a creature 
					isn't intentionally hiding but is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot 
					check is necessary to notice it.<br>
      <br>

					A Spot check result higher than 20 generally lets you become aware of an 
					invisible creature near you, though you can't actually see it.<br>
      <br>

					Spot is also used to detect someone in disguise (see the Disguise skill), and 
					to read lips when you can't hear or understand what someone is saying.<br>
      <br>

					Spot checks may be called for to determine the distance at which an encounter 
					begins. A penalty applies on such checks, depending on the distance between the 
					two individuals or groups, and an additional penalty may apply if the character 
					making the Spot check is distracted (not concentrating on being observant).<br>

					<i>Read Lips:</i> To understand what someone is saying by reading lips, you 
					must be within 30 feet of the speaker, be able to see him or her speak, and 
					understand the speaker's language. (This use of the skill is 
					language-dependent.) The base DC is 15, but it increases for complex speech or 
					an inarticulate speaker. You must maintain a line of sight to the lips being 
					read.<br>
      <br>

					If your Spot check succeeds, you can understand the general content of a 
					minute's worth of speaking, but you usually still miss certain details. If the 
					check fails by 4 or less, you can't read the speaker's lips. If the check fails 
					by 5 or more, you draw some incorrect conclusion about the speech. The check is 
					rolled secretly in this case, so that you don't know whether you succeeded or 
					missed by 5.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. Every time you have a chance to spot 
					something in a reactive manner you can make a Spot check without using an 
					action. Trying to spot something you failed to see previously is a move action. 
					To read lips, you must concentrate for a full minute before making a Spot 
					check, and you can't perform any other action (other than moving at up to half 
					speed) during this minute.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. You can try to spot something that you 
					failed to see previously at no penalty. You can attempt to read lips once per 
					minute.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;A fascinated creature takes a -4 penalty on Spot 
					checks made as reactions.<br>
      <br>

					If you have the Alertness feat, you get a +2 bonus on Spot checks.<br>
      <br>

					A ranger gains a bonus on Spot checks when using this skill against a favored 
					enemy.<br>
      <br>

					An elf has a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.<br>
      <br>

					A half-elf has a +1 racial bonus on Spot checks.<br>
      <br>

					The master of a hawk familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in daylight or 
					other lighted areas.<br>
      <br>

					The master of an owl familiar gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadowy or 
					other darkened areas.
