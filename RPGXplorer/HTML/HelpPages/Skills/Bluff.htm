					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;A Bluff check is opposed by the target's Sense 
					Motive check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of 
					bluffs and the modifier to the target's Sense Motive check for each one.<br>



      <br>




					Favorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a 
					bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, 
					or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, 
					nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it's important, you can 
					distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn't believe it 
					and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, 
					if the target gets a +10 bonus on its Sense Motive check because the bluff 
					demands something risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less, 
					then the target didn't so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go 
					along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.<br>



      <br>




					A successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least 
					for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want 
					it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion spell.
					<br>


      <br>




					A bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of 
					you cannot be bluffed.<br>



      <br>




					<i>Feinting in Combat:</i> You can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in 
					melee combat (so that it can't dodge your next attack effectively). To feint, 
					make a Bluff check opposed by your target's Sense Motive check, but in this 
					case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other 
					applicable modifiers.<br>



      <br>




					If your Bluff check result exceeds this special Sense Motive check result, your 
					target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack 
					you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.<br>



      <br>




					Feinting in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it's harder to 
					read a strange creature's body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff 
					check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it's even harder; you 
					take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it's impossible.<br>



      <br>




					Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br>



      <br>




					<i>Creating a Diversion to Hide:</i> You can use the Bluff skill to help you 
					hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to 
					attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke 
					an attack of opportunity.<br>



      <br>




					<i>Delivering a Secret Message:</i> You can use Bluff to get a message across 
					to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple 
					messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting 
					across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can't get the message 
					across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied 
					or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a Sense Motive check 
					opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your 
					message (see Sense Motive).<br>



      <br>




					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. A Bluff check made as part of general 
					interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a full-round 
					action), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff 
					check made to feint in combat or create a diversion to hide is a standard 
					action. A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn't take an action; 
					it is part of normal communication.<br>



      <br>




					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. Generally, a failed Bluff check in 
					social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the 
					same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to feint in 
					combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you 
					may attempt such a retry only once per round.<br>



      <br>




					Each retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.<br>



      <br>




					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;A ranger gains a bonus on Bluff checks when 
					using this skill against a favored enemy.<br>



      <br>




					The master of a snake familiar gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.<br>



      <br>




					If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.<br>



      <br>




					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a 
					+2 bonus on Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sleight of Hand checks, as well as on 
					Disguise checks made when you know you're being observed and you try to act in 
					character.<br>
