					Use this skill to activate magic<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;You can use this skill to read a spell or to 
					activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had 
					the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a 
					different race, or as if you were of a different alignment.<br>
      <br>

					You make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a 
					wand. If you are using the check to emulate an alignment or some other quality 
					in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once 
					per hour.<br>
      <br>

					You must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must 
					know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for 
					that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are 
					summarized on the table below.<br>

					<i>Activate Blindly:</i> Some magic items are activated by special words, 
					thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the 
					activation word, thought, or action, even when you're not and even if you don't 
					know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the 
					check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to 
					get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check 
					if you've activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 
					or less, you can't activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a 
					mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn't do what 
					you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong 
					target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of 
					damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you 
					normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise 
					cast yourself.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Decipher a Written Spell:</i> This usage works just like deciphering a 
					written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. 
					Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Emulate an Ability Score:</i> To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high 
					score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for 
					divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability 
					score (appropriate to the class you're emulating when you try to cast the spell 
					from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already 
					have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don't need to make 
					this check.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Emulate an Alignment:</i> Some magic items have positive or negative effects 
					based on the user's alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if 
					you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at 
					a time.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Emulate a Class Feature:</i> Sometimes you need to use a class feature to 
					activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class 
					equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you 
					actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate 
					items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are 
					emulating has an alignment requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by 
					emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see 
					above).<br>
      <br>

					<i>Emulate a Race:</i> Some magic items work only for members of certain races, 
					or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you 
					were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Use a Scroll:</i> If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to 
					decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the 
					scroll's spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a 
					scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is 
					equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the 
					scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 
					+ spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don't have a sufficient score 
					in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic 
					Device check (see above).<br>
      <br>

					This use of the skill also applies to other spell completion magic items.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Use a Wand:</i> Normally, to use a wand, you must have the wand's spell on 
					your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you 
					had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also 
					applies to other spell trigger magic items, such as staffs.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;None. The Use Magic Device check is made as part 
					of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while 
					attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can't try to activate 
					that item again for 24 hours.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;You cannot take 10 with this skill.<br>
      <br>

					You can't aid another on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may 
					attempt such a check.<br>
      <br>

					If you have the Magical Aptitude feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device 
					checks.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Spellcraft, you 
					get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Decipher Script, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic 
					Device checks related to scrolls.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to 
					Spellcraft checks made to decipher spells on scrolls.
