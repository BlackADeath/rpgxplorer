					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a 
					coin-sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of legerdemain, such as 
					making a coin disappear, also has a DC of 10 unless an observer is determined 
					to note where the item went.<br>
      <br>

					When you use this skill under close observation, your skill check is opposed by 
					the observer's Spot check. The observer's success doesn't prevent you from 
					performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.<br>
      <br>

					You can hide a small object (including a light weapon or an easily concealed 
					ranged weapon, such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your body. Your 
					Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone observing you or 
					the Search check of anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher gains 
					a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it's generally easier to find such an 
					object than to hide it. A dagger is easier to hide than most light weapons, and 
					grants you a +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An 
					extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or ring, grants you a 
					+4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it, and heavy or baggy 
					clothing (such as a cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check.<br>
      <br>

					Drawing a hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn't provoke an attack of 
					opportunity.<br>
      <br>

					If you try to take something from another creature, you must make a DC 20 
					Sleight of Hand check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to detect 
					the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand check result you achieved when 
					you tried to grab the item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the 
					attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.<br>
      <br>

					You can also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as though you were 
					using the Perform skill. In such a case, your "act" encompasses elements of 
					legerdemain, juggling, and the like.<br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Any Sleight of Hand check normally is a standard 
					action. However, you may perform a Sleight of Hand check as a free action by 
					taking a -20 penalty on the check.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, but after an initial failure, a second 
					Sleight of Hand attempt against the same target (or while you are being watched 
					by the same observer who noticed your previous attempt) increases the DC for 
					the task by 10.<br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;If you have the Deft Hands feat, you get a +2 
					bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a 
					+2 bonus on Sleight of Hand checks.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Untrained:</strong>&nbsp;An untrained Sleight of Hand check is simply a 
					Dexterity check. Without actual training, you can't succeed on any Sleight of 
					Hand check with a DC higher than 10, except for hiding an object on your body.
