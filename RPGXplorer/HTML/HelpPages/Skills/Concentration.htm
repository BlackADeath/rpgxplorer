					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;You must make a Concentration check whenever you 
					might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) 
					while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions 
					include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, 
					using a spell-like ability, or using a skill that would provoke an attack of 
					opportunity. In general, if an action wouldn't normally provoke an attack of 
					opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.<br>

      <br>


					If the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as 
					normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If 
					you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were 
					concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased 
					concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the 
					spell remains active. If you were using a spell-like ability, that use of the 
					ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed skill check 
					may have other ramifications as well.<br>

      <br>


					The table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make 
					a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a 
					spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the 
					appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, 
					make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the 
					task is not completed.<br>

      <span class="HelpTableNotes">1 - If you are trying to cast, concentrate on, or direct 
						a spell when the distraction occurs, add the level of the spell to the 
						indicated DC.<br>


						2 - Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time of 1 round or more, 
						or the execution of an activity that takes more than a single full-round action 
						(such as Disable Device). Also, damage stemming from an attack of opportunity 
						or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a 
						casting time of 1 action) or the action being taken (for activities requiring 
						no more than a full-round action).<br>


						3 - Such as from acid arrow.<br>


						4 - If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a 
						save. </span>
					<br>


					<br>


					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;None. Making a Concentration check doesn't take 
					an action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part of 
					another action (when attempted actively).<br>

      <br>


					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, though a success doesn't cancel the 
					effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or 
					the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.<br>

      <br>


					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;You can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a 
					spell-like ability, or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid attacks of 
					opportunity altogether. This doesn't apply to other actions that might provoke 
					attacks of opportunity.<br>

      <br>


					The DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell's level, if casting a spell or using 
					a spell-like ability defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may 
					attempt the action normally without provoking any attacks of opportunity. A 
					successful Concentration check still doesn't allow you to take 10 on another 
					check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If 
					the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails 
					(with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your 
					concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.
					<br>

      <br>


					A character with the Combat Casting feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration 
					checks made to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability while on the defensive 
					or while grappling or pinned.<br>
