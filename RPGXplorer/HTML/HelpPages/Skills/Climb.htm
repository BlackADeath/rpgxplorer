					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;With a successful Climb check, you can advance up, 
					down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling 
					with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be 
					any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline 
					at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.<br>

      <br>



					A Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one 
					that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have 
					already attained.<br>

      <br>



					A climber's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Climb checks.<br>

      <br>



					The DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task 
					with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.<br>

1 - These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.<br>



					</span>
					<br>



					You need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand 
					while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. 
					While climbing, you can't move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity 
					bonus to AC (if any). You also can't use a shield while climbing.<br>

      <br>



					Any time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of 
					the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain 
					the appropriate falling damage.<br>

      <br>



					<i>Accelerated Climbing:</i> You try to climb more quickly than normal. By 
					accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter 
					your speed).<br>

      <br>



					<i>Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds:</i> You can make your own handholds 
					and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per 
					piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that 
					offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the 
					same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an 
					ice wall.<br>

      <br>



					<i>Catching Yourself When Falling:</i> It's practically impossible to catch 
					yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 20) to 
					do so. It's much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope's DC + 10).<br>

      <br>



					<i>Catching a Falling Character While Climbing:</i> If someone climbing above 
					you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if 
					he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee touch 
					attack against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego 
					any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt 
					a Climb check (DC = wall's DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the 
					falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot 
					exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb 
					check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character's fall but don't lose your 
					grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character's 
					fall and begin falling as well.<br>

      <br>



					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Climbing is part of movement, so it's generally 
					part of a move action (and may be combined with other types of movement in a 
					move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate 
					Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn't take an 
					action.<br>

      <br>



					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;You can use a rope to haul a character upward 
					(or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum 
					load in this manner.<br>

      <br>



					A halfling has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile 
					and surefooted.<br>

      <br>



					The master of a lizard familiar gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.<br>

      <br>



					If you have the Athletic feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.<br>

      <br>



					A creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The 
					creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher 
					than 0, but it always can choose to take 10, even if rushed or threatened while 
					climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see 
					above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is 
					slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains 
					its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get 
					no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run 
					action while climbing.<br>

      <br>



					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get 
					a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a 
					rope-and-wall combination.<br>
