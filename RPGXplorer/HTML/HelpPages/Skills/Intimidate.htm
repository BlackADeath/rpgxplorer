					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;You can change another's behavior with a 
					successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target's modified 
					level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target's Wisdom bonus [if 
					any] + target's modifiers on saves against fear). If you beat your target's 
					check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of 
					actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its 
					normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your 
					behalf while intimidated. See the Diplomacy skill, above, for additional 
					details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and 
					for 1d6&Atilde;&mdash;10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target's default attitude 
					toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).<br>
      <br>

					If you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or 
					useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Demoralize Opponent:</i> You can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent's 
					resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target's 
					modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes shaken for 1 
					round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, 
					and saving throws. You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in 
					melee combat and that can see you.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. Changing another's behavior requires 1 
					minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a standard action.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Optional, but not recommended because retries 
					usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character 
					can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn't help. If the initial check 
					fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist 
					the intimidator, and a retry is futile.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;You gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for 
					every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take 
					a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are 
					smaller than your target.<br>
      <br>

					A character immune to fear can't be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent 
					creatures.<br>
      <br>

					If you have the Persuasive feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a 
					+2 bonus on Intimidate checks.<br>
