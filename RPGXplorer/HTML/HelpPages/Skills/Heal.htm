					<i>First Aid:</i> You usually use first aid to save a dying character. If a 
					character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 
					per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable 
					character regains no hit points but stops losing them.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Long-Term Care:</i> Providing long-term care means treating a wounded person 
					for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit 
					points or ability score points (lost to ability damage) at twice the normal 
					rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit 
					points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for 
					a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of 
					complete rest.<br>
      <br>

					You can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and 
					supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled 
					lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You 
					cannot give long-term care to yourself.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Treat Wound from Caltrop, Spike Growth, or Spike Stones:</i> A creature 
					wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at one-half normal speed. A successful 
					Heal check removes this movement penalty.<br>
      <br>

					A creature wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a 
					Reflex save or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another 
					character can remove this penalty by taking 10 minutes to dress the victim's 
					injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell's save DC.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Treat Poison:</i> To treat poison means to tend a single character who has 
					been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the poison (or suffer 
					some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a saving throw 
					against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your 
					check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.<br>
      <br>

					<i>Treat Disease:</i> To treat a disease means to tend a single diseased 
					character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw against disease effects, 
					you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or 
					her saving throw, whichever is higher.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Providing first aid, treating a wound, or 
					treating poison is a standard action. Treating a disease or tending a creature 
					wounded by a spike growth or spike stones spell takes 10 minutes of work. 
					Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. Generally speaking, you can't try a 
					Heal check again without proof of the original check's failure. You can always 
					retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt 
					is still alive.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;A character with the Self-Sufficient feat gets a 
					+2 bonus on Heal checks.<br>
      <br>

					A healer's kit gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Heal checks.
