					Like the Craft and Profession skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number 
					of unrelated skills. Knowledge represents a study of some body of lore, 
					possibly an academic or even scientific discipline.<br>

					Below are listed typical fields of study.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Arcana (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, cryptic phrases, 
					constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>
        <li>
					Architecture and engineering (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</li>
        <li>
					Dungeoneering (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>
        <li>
					Geography (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>
        <li>
					History (royalty, wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</li>
        <li>
					Local (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, 
					humanoids)</li>
        <li>
					Nature (animals, fey, giants, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and 
					cycles, weather, vermin)</li>
        <li>
					Nobility and royalty (lineages, heraldry, family trees, mottoes, 
					personalities)</li>
        <li>
					Religion (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy 
					symbols, undead)</li>
        <li>
					The planes (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the 
					Ethereal Plane, outsiders, elementals, magic related to the planes)</li>
      </ul>

					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;Answering a question within your field of study 
					has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 
					30 (for really tough questions).<br>
      <br>

					In many cases, you can use this skill to identify monsters and their special 
					powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the 
					monster's HD. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful 
					information about that monster.<br>
      <br>

					For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall 
					another piece of useful information.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Usually none. In most cases, making a Knowledge 
					check doesn't take an action-you simply know the answer or you don't.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;No. The check represents what you know, and 
					thinking about a topic a second time doesn't let you know something that you 
					never learned in the first place.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Synergy:</strong>&nbsp;If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge 
					(arcana), you get a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (architecture and engineering), you 
					get a +2 bonus on Search checks made to find secret doors or hidden 
					compartments.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (geography), you get a +2 bonus on 
					Survival checks made to keep from getting lost or to avoid natural hazards.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), you get a +2 bonus on 
					bardic knowledge checks.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (local), you get a +2 bonus on Gather 
					Information checks.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nature), you get a +2 bonus on 
					Survival checks made in aboveground natural environments (aquatic, desert, 
					forest, hill, marsh, mountains, or plains).<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (nobility and royalty), you get a +2 
					bonus on Diplomacy checks.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), you get a +2 bonus on 
					turning checks against undead.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (the planes), you get a +2 bonus on 
					Survival checks made while on other planes.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (dungeoneering), you get a +2 bonus on 
					Survival checks made while underground.<br>
      <br>

					If you have 5 or more ranks in Survival, you get a +2 bonus on Knowledge 
					(nature) checks.<br>
      <br>

					<strong>Untrained:</strong>&nbsp;An untrained Knowledge check is simply an 
					Intelligence check. Without actual training, you know only common knowledge (DC 
					10 or lower).<br>
