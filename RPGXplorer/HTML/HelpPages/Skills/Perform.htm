					Like Craft, Knowledge, and Profession, Perform is actually a number of separate 
					skills.<br>

      <br>


					You could have several Perform skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased 
					as a separate skill.<br>

      <br>


					Each of the nine categories of the Perform skill includes a variety of methods, 
					instruments, or techniques, a small list of which is provided for each category 
					below.<br>

      
      <ul>

        <li>
					Act (comedy, drama, mime)</li>

        <li>
					Comedy (buffoonery, limericks, joke-telling)</li>

        <li>Dance (ballet, waltz, jig)</li>

        <li>
					Keyboard instruments (harpsichord, piano, pipe organ)</li>

        <li>
					Oratory (epic, ode, storytelling)</li>

        <li>
					Percussion instruments (bells, chimes, drums, gong)</li>

        <li>
					String instruments (fiddle, harp, lute, mandolin)</li>

        <li>
					Wind instruments (flute, pan pipes, recorder, shawm, trumpet)</li>

        <li>
					Sing (ballad, chant, melody)</li>

      
      </ul>


					<strong>Check:</strong>&nbsp;You can impress audiences with your talent and 
					skill.<br>

					A masterwork musical instrument gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Perform 
					checks that involve its use.<br>

      <br>


					<strong>Action:</strong>&nbsp;Varies. Trying to earn money by playing in public 
					requires anywhere from an evening's work to a full day's performance. The 
					bard's special Perform-based abilities are described in that class's 
					description.<br>

      <br>


					<strong>Try Again:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. Retries are allowed, but they don't 
					negate previous failures, and an audience that has been unimpressed in the past 
					is likely to be prejudiced against future performances. (Increase the DC by 2 
					for each previous failure.)<br>

      <br>


					<strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;A bard must have at least 3 ranks in a Perform 
					skill to inspire courage in his allies, or to use his countersong or his <i>fascinate</i>
					ability. A bard needs 6 ranks in a Perform skill to inspire competence, 9 ranks 
					to use his <i>suggestion ability</i>, 12 ranks to inspire greatness, 15 ranks 
					to use his <i>song of freedom ability</i>, 18 ranks to inspire heroics, and 21 
					ranks to use his <i>mass suggestion</i> ability. See Bardic Music in the bard 
					class description.<br>

      <br>


					In addition to using the Perform skill, you can entertain people with sleight 
					of hand, tumbling, tightrope walking, and spells (especially illusions).
