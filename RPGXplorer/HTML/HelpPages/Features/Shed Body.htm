Starting at 2nd level, a psion uncarnate can become incorporeal (or
&ldquo;uncarnate&rdquo;) once per day as a standard action. The
character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time,
the character&rsquo;s body fades into an immaterial form that retains
the character&rsquo;s basic likeness. While uncarnate, the character
gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a fly speed equal
to his land speed (perfect maneuverability). His material armor remains
in place and continues to provide its armor bonus to AC (see Uncarnate
Armor, above). His material weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his
physical form allows the character to more easily access his mental
abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he
manifests while uncarnate.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">He can use equipment normally, deriving
benefits from items that enhance his capabilities; however, all his
equipment remains material even when the character is uncarnate (but
see the assume equipment ability, described below).&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Often, a psion uncarnate appears almost like
a ghost wearing items of the material world. This doesn&rsquo;t make
his equipment more susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended
objects apply), but it does make it impossible for the character to
enter or pass through solid objects while wearing solid equipment. If
he drops his material equipment, he can pass through solid objects at
will as described below.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">At 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Incorporeal Subtype: An incorporeal psion
uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that strike as magic
weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or supernatural abilities.
He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms. Even when hit by spells or
magic weapons, he has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a
corporeal source (except for positive energy, negative energy, force
effects, or attacks made with ghost touch weapons).</p>
      <p class="HelpText">An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural
armor bonus&mdash;and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not
gain a deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal
psion uncarnate can enter or pass through solid objects (subject to the
restrictions described in the shed body and assume equipment
abilities), but must remain adjacent to the object&rsquo;s exterior,
and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger
than his own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within
a square adjacent to his current location, but enemies have total
concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal psion uncarnate that
is inside an object. To see farther from the object he is in and attack
normally, the incorporeal psion uncarnate must emerge. An incorporeal
psion uncarnate inside an object has total cover, but when he attacks a
creature outside the object he only has cover, so a creature outside
with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal
psion uncarnate cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">An incorporeal psion uncarnate&rsquo;s
attacks pass through (ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields,
although deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against
him. He can pass through and operate in water as easily as he does in
air. An incorporeal psion uncarnate cannot fall or take falling damage.
He cannot make trip or grapple attacks, nor can he be tripped or
grappled. In fact, he cannot take any physical action that would move
or manipulate an opponent or its equipment, nor is he subject to such
actions.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do
not set off traps that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal creature
moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it
doesn&rsquo;t wish to be. It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity
modifier applies to both its melee attack rolls and its ranged attack
rolls. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are either
ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and
can move at full speed even when they cannot see.</p>
