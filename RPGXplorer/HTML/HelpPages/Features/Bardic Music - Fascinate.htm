Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to
produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself,
if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic
music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they
can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical
songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing
an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability
requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the
Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number
of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic
music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.<br>
      <br>
Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music
abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a
standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using
bardic music that doesn&rsquo;t require concentration, a bard cannot
cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just
as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20%
chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the
attempt still counts against his daily limit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Fascinate (Sp):</span> A bard
with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to
cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each
creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear
the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able
to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other
dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a
bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a
single use of this ability.<br>
      <br>
To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is
the DC for each affected creature&rsquo;s Will save against the effect.
If a creature&rsquo;s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to
fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails,
the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other
actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up
to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target
takes a &ndash;4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as
Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make
another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw
against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.<br>
      <br>
Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell,
or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the
effect. <span style="font-style: italic;">Fascinate</span> is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.
