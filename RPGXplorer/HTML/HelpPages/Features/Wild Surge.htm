      <p class="HelpText"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Wild Surge (Su): </span>A
wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild
surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains
phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use
of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="HelpText">A wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge
whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her
manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester
level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher
degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point
for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would
normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by
the wild surge.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Level-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">This improvement in manifester level does not
grant her any other benefits (psicrystal abilities do not advance, she
does not gain higher-level class abilities, and so on).</p>
      <p class="HelpText">She cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">At 3rd level, a wilder can choose to boost
her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she can boost
her manifester level by up to three; at 11th level, by up to four; at
15th level, by up to five; and at 19th level, by up to six.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">In all cases, the wild surge effectively pays
the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the
power; only the unaugmented power point cost is subtracted from the
wilder&rsquo;s power point reserve.</p>
