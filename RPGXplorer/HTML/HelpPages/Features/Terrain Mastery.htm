      <p class="HelpText"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Terrain Mastery:</span>
Each time this feature is gained the character adds a new terrain
environment to their repertoire from those given below. Terrain mastery
gives a bonus on checks involving a skill useful in that terrain, or
some other appropriate benefit. The character also knows how to fight
dangerous creatures typically found in that terrain, gaining a +1
insight bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls against creatures with
that terrain mentioned in the Environment entry of their descriptions.
The character only gains the bonus if the creature description
specifically lists the terrain type.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Characters take their terrain mastery with
them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses on
skill checks, attack rolls, and damage rolls whether they&rsquo;re
actually in the relevant terrain or not.</p>
