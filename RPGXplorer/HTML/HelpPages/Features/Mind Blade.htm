As a move action, a soulknife can create a semisolid blade composed of
psychic energy distilled from his own mind. The blade is identical in
all ways (except visually) to a short sword of a size appropriate for
its wielder. For instance, a Medium soulknife materializes a Medium
mind blade that he can wield as a light weapon, and the blade deals 1d6
points of damage (crit 19&ndash;20/x2). Soulknives who are smaller or
larger than Medium create mind blades identical to short swords
appropriate for their size, with a corresponding change to the
blade&rsquo;s damage. The wielder of a mind blade gains the usual
benefits to his attack roll and damage roll from a high Strength bonus.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">The blade can be broken (it has hardness 10
and 10 hit points); however, a soulknife can simply create another on
his next move action. The moment he relinquishes his grip on his blade,
it dissipates (unless he intends to throw it; see below). A mind blade
is considered a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">A soulknife can use feats such as Power
Attack or Combat Expertise in conjunction with the mind blade just as
if it were a normal weapon. He can also choose mind blade for feats
requiring a specific weapon choice, such as Weapon Specialization.
Powers or spells that upgrade weapons can be used on a mind blade.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">A soulknife&rsquo;s mind blade improves as
the character gains higher levels. At 4th level and every four levels
thereafter, the mind blade gains a cumulative +1 enhancement bonus on
attack rolls and damage rolls (+2 at 8th level, +3 at 12th level, +4 at
16th level, and +5 at 20th level).</p>
      <p class="HelpText">Even in places where psionic effects do not
normally function (such as within a null psionics field), a soulknife
can attempt to sustain his mind blade by making a DC 20 Will save. On a
successful save, the soulknife maintains his mind blade for a number of
rounds equal to his class level before he needs to check again. On an
unsuccessful attempt, the mind blade vanishes. As a move action on his
turn, the soulknife can attempt a new Will save to rematerialize his
mind blade while he remains within the psionics negating effect.</p>
