When he adopts a defensive stance, the defender gains phenomenal
strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is
defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 resistance
bonus on all saves, and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The increase in
Constitution increases the defender&rsquo;s hit points by 2 points per
level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance
when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points
are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a
defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would
require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a
number of rounds equal to 3 + the character&rsquo;s (newly improved)
Constitution modifier. The defender may end his defensive stance
voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance,
the defender is winded and takes a &ndash;2 penalty to Strength for the
duration of that encounter. The defender can only use his defensive
stance a certain number of times per day as stated in the feature name.
Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can
only do so during his action.</td>
