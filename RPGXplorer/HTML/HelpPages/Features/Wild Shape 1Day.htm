At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small
or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms
include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like
the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour
per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or
back) is a standard action and doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of
opportunity.<br>
The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="HelpText">A druid loses her ability to speak while in
animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal,
untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other
animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound
a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not
permit speech.)<br>
      </p>
      <p class="HelpText">A druid can use this ability more times per
day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level. In addition, she gains the
ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal
at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level.<br>
The new form&rsquo;s Hit Dice can&rsquo;t exceed the character&rsquo;s druid level.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use
wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size
restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can&rsquo;t use this ability
to take the form of a plant that isn&rsquo;t a creature.)</p>
      <p class="HelpText">At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use
wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air,
earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in
addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal
effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental&rsquo;s
extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains
the elemental&rsquo;s feats for as long as she maintains the wild
shape, but she retains her own creature type.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume
elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three
times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability
to change into a Huge elemental.&nbsp;</p>
