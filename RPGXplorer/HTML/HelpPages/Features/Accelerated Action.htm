When she attains 10th level, an elocater can accelerate herself and
thereby take more actions than normal. An elocater can accelerate
herself for a total of 5 rounds per day. She can choose to parcel out
her accelerated actions in 1-round increments. (This effect is not
cumulative with similar effects that provide additional actions, such
as schism or a haste spell&mdash;and in fact an elocater can&rsquo;t
take an accelerated action if affected by these or similar effects.)</p>
      <p class="HelpText">If she makes a full attack while accelerated,
an elocater can make one extra attack with any weapon she is holding.
The attack is made using her full base attack bonus, plus any modifiers
appropriate to the situation. If the elocater uses her accelerated
action to move, she gains an enhancement bonus to her speed of +30
feet. The elocater can use her accelerated action to manifest a power,
as long as she has not already manifested a power in the current round
and the one she wants to manifest has a manifesting time of 1 standard
action or shorter. While accelerated, she gains a +2 dodge bonus on
attack rolls and Reflex saves and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class. Any
condition that makes her lose her Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if
any) also makes her lose these dodge bonuses.&nbsp;</p>
