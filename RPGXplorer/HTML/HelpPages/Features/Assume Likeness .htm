At 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can
assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a
standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The
character&rsquo;s abilities do not change, but he appears to be the
creature that he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to
effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his
true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a
successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature&rsquo;s Sense Motive
check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate&rsquo;s new
appearance. The psion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his
true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for
instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it
fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails.
However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his
telekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item.</p>
      <p class="HelpText">When using his assume likeness ability, a
psion uncarnate has an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise
checks. If he can read an opponent&rsquo;s mind, he gets a further +4
circumstance bonus on Bluff and Disguise checks.</p>
