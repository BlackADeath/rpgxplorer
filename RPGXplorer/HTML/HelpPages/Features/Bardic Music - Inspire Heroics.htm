      <p class="HelpText"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bardic Music: </span>Once
per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce
magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if
desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music
and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can
all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs,
singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an
instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability
requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the
Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number
of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic
music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.<br>

      </p>

      
      <p class="HelpText">Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music
abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a
standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using
bardic music that doesn&rsquo;t require concentration, a bard cannot
cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just
as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20%
chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the
attempt still counts against his daily limit.</p>


      
      
      <p class="HelpText"><span style="font-style: italic;">Inspire Heroics (Su): </span>A
bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill
can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a
single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the
character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional
creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear
the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4
morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect
lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5
rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.</p>
