Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to
produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself,
if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic
music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they
can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical
songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing
an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability
requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the
Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number
of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic
music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.<br>
      <br>
Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music
abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a
standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using
bardic music that doesn&rsquo;t require concentration, a bard cannot
cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as
scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just
as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20%
chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the
attempt still counts against his daily limit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Inspire Courage (Su): </span>A
bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to
inspire courage in his allies (including himself ), bolstering them
against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an
ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long
as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An
affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm
and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage
rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus
increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage
is a mind-affecting ability.</td>
