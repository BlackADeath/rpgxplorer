      <p><strong>Elemental Command:</strong> All four kinds of elemental command rings 
						are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring 
						until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly 
						slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material 
						of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the 
						following common properties.
					</p>


					
      
      <p>Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or 
						even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this 
						protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will 
						DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is 
						lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.
					</p>


					
      
      <p>Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take 
						a -1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving 
						throws from the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He 
						gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon 
						he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any 
						qualities the weapon may or may not have.
					</p>


					
      
      <p>The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to 
						which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring. 
						They show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If 
						alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is 
						weak, they hate and desire to slay him.
					</p>


					
      
      <p>The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as 
						follows:
