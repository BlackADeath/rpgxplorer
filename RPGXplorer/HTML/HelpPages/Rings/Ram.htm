      <p><strong>Ram:</strong> The ring of the ram is an ornate ring forged of hard 
						metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device. 
						The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a 
						vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This 
						force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is 
						expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the 
						maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range 
						and no penalties for distance.
					</p>

					
      <p>The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject 
						to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. (The ram has Strength 25 
						and is Large.) The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges 
						are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.
					</p>

					
      <p>In addition to its attack mode, the ring of the ram also has the power to open 
						doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. If 2 charges are expended, 
						the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are 
						expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.
					</p>

					
      <p>A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring 
						becomes a nonmagical item.
					</p>

					
      <p>Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; Forge Ring, bull's strength, telekinesis; Price 
						8,600 gp.</p>
