      <p>Withdrawing from melee combat is a full-round action. When you
withdraw, you can move up to double your speed. The square you start
out in is not considered threatened by any opponent you can see, and
therefore visible enemies do not get attacks of opportunity against you
when you move from that square. (Invisible enemies still get attacks of
opportunity against you, and you can&rsquo;t withdraw from combat if
you&rsquo;re blinded.) You can&rsquo;t take a 5-foot step during the
same round in which you withdraw.</p>
      <p>If, during the process of withdrawing, you move out of a
threatened square (other than the one you started in), enemies get
attacks of opportunity as normal.</p>
      <p>You may not withdraw using a form of movement for which you don&rsquo;t have a listed speed.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Note that despite the name of this action, you don&rsquo;t actually have to leave combat entirely.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Restricted Withdraw:</span>
If you are limited to taking only a standard action each round you can
withdraw as a standard action. In this case, you may move up to your
speed (rather than up to double your speed).
