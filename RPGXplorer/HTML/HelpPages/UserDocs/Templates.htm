      <p>Certain creatures are created by adding a template to an
existing creature. A templated creature can represent a freak of
nature, the individual creation of a single experimenter, or the first
generation of offspring from parents of different species.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acquired and Inherited Templates: </span>Some
templates can be added to creatures anytime. Templates such as these
are referred to as acquired templates, indicating that the creature did
not always have the attributes of the template.</p>
      <p>Other templates, known as inherited templates, are part of a
creature from the beginning of its existence. Creatures are born with
these templates.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s possible for a certain kind of template to be of either type. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reading a Template: </span>A
template&rsquo;s description provides a set of instructions for
altering an existing creature, known as the base creature. The changes
that a template might cause to each line of a creature &rsquo;s
statistics block are discussed below. Generally, if a template does not
cause a change to a certain statistic, that entry is missing from the
template description. For clarity, the entry for a statistic or
attribute that is not changed is sometimes given as &ldquo;Same as the
base creature.&rdquo; </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size and Type:</span> Templates often change a creature&rsquo;s type, and may change the creature&rsquo;s size.</p>
      <p>If a template changes the base creature&rsquo;s type, the
creature also acquires the augmented subtype unless the template
description indicates otherwise. The augmented subtype is always paired
with the creature&rsquo;s original type. Unless a template indicates
otherwise, the new creature has the traits of the new type but the
features of the original type.</p>
      <p>If a template changes a creature&rsquo;s size, use Table:
Changes to Statistics by Size to calculate changes to natural armor,
Armor Class, attack rolls, and grapple bonus.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice and Hit Points:</span>
Most templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a monster has, but
some do. Some templates change the size of a creature&rsquo;s Hit Dice
(usually by changing the creature type). A few templates change
previously acquired Hit Dice, and continue to change Hit Dice gained
with class levels, but most templates that change Hit Dice change only
the creature&rsquo;s original HD and leave class Hit Dice unchanged.</p>
      <p>If the Hit Dice entry in a template description is missing,
Hit Dice and hit points do not change unless the creature&rsquo;s
Constitution modifier changes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initiative:</span> If a template changes the monster&rsquo;s Dexterity, or if it adds or removes the Improved Initiative feat, this entry changes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> If a template
modifies a creature&rsquo;s speed, the template states how that
happens. More commonly, a template adds a new movement mode.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> If a
template changes the creature&rsquo;s size, see Table: Changes to
Statistics by Size to determine its new Armor Class and to see whether
its natural armor changes. In some cases the method of determining
Armor Class changes radically; the template description explains how to
adjust the creature&rsquo;s AC.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Base Attack/Grapple:</span>
Templates usually do not change a creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus.
If a template modifies a creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, the
template description states how that happens. Changes to a
creature&rsquo;s Strength score can change a creature&rsquo;s grapple
bonus, as can changes to its size.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack and Full Attack:</span>
Most templates do not change a creature&rsquo;s attack bonus or modes
of attack, even when the creature&rsquo;s type changes (the
creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus is the same as a creature of the
original type). Of course, any change in ability scores may affect
attack bonuses. If Strength or Dexterity changes, use the new modifier
to determine attack bonuses. A change in a monster&rsquo;s size also
changes its attack bonus; see Table: Changes to Statistics by Size.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage:</span> Damage changes
with Strength. If the creature uses a two-handed weapon or has a single
natural weapon, it adds 1-1/2 times its Strength bonus to the damage.
If it has more than a single attack then it adds its Strength bonus to
damage rolls for the primary attack and 1/2 its Strength bonus to all
secondary attacks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space/Reach:</span> A
template may change this entry if it changes the monster&rsquo;s size.
Note that this table does not take into account special situations such
as exceptional reach.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks:</span> A
template may add or remove special attacks. The template description
gives the details of any special attacks a template provides, including
how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities: </span>A
template may add or remove special qualities. The template description
gives the details of any special qualities a template provides,
including how to determine saving throw DCs, if applicable. Even if the
special qualities entry is missing from a template description, the
creature still gains any qualities associated with its new type.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Base Saves:</span> As with
attacks, changing a monster&rsquo;s type does not always change its
base saving throw bonuses. You only need to adjust them for new
modifiers for Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom. A template may,
however, state that a monster has a different &ldquo;good&rdquo; saving
throw.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities:</span> If a template changes one or more ability scores, these changes are noted here.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills:</span> As with
attacks, changing a monster&rsquo;s type does not always change its
skill points. Most templates don&rsquo;t change the number of Hit Dice
a creature has, so you don&rsquo;t need to adjust skills in that case
unless the key abilities for those skills have changed, or the template
gives a bonus on one or more skills, or unless the template gives a
feat that provides a bonus on a skill check. </p>
      <p>Some templates change how skill points are determined, but
this change usually only affects skill points gained after the template
is applied. Treat skills listed in the base creature&rsquo;s
description as class skills, as well as any new skills provided by the
template. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats:</span> Since most
templates do not change the number of Hit Dice a creature has, a
template will not change the number of feats the creature has. Some
templates grant one or more bonus feats.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment:</span> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span> Most
templates increase the creature&rsquo;s Challenge Rating. A template
might provide a modifier to be added to the base creature&rsquo;s CR,
or it might specify a range of modifiers depending on the base
creature&rsquo;s original Hit Dice or CR.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure:</span> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> Usually the same as the base creature, unless the template is associated with a certain alignment.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advancement:</span> Usually the same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level Adjustment:</span> This
entry is a modifier to the base creature&rsquo;s level adjustment. Any
level adjustment is meaningless unless the creature retains a high
enough Intelligence (minimum 3) to gain class levels after applying the
template.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding More Than One Template: </span>In
theory, there&rsquo;s no limit to the number of templates you can add
to a creature. To add more than one template, just apply each template
one at a time. Always apply inherited templates before applying
acquired templates. Whenever you add multiple templates, pay attention
to the creature&rsquo;s type - you may add a template that makes the
creature ineligible for other templates you might want to add.</p>
