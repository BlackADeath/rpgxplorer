      <p>Spells developed with the heal seed channel positive energy
into a creature to wipe away disease and injury. Such a spell
completely cures all diseases, blindness, deafness, hit point damage,
and temporary ability damage. To restore permanently drained ability
score points, increase the Spellcraft DC by +6. The heal seed
neutralizes poisons in the subject&rsquo;s system so that no additional
damage or effects are suffered. It offsets feeblemindedness and cures
mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain. It dispels
all magical effects penalizing the character&rsquo;s abilities,
including effects caused by spells, even epic spells developed with the
afflict seed. Only a single application of the spell is needed to
simultaneously achieve all these effects. This seed does not restore
levels or Constitution points lost due to death. To dispel all negative
levels afflicting the target, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. This
reverses level drains by a force or creature. The drained levels are
restored only if the creature lost the levels within the last 20 weeks.
For each additional week since the levels were drained, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. </p>

      
      <p>Against undead, the influx of positive energy causes the loss
of all but 1d4 hit points if the undead fails a Fortitude saving throw.
      </p>

      
      <p>An epic caster with 24 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge
(nature), or Knowledge (religion) can cast a spell developed with a
special version of the heal seed that flushes negative energy into the
subject, healing undead completely but causing the loss of all but 1d4
hit points in living creatures if they fail a Fortitude saving throw.
Alternatively, a living target that fails its Fortitude saving throw
could gain four negative levels for the next 8 hours. For each
additional negative level bestowed, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4,
and for each extra hour the negative levels persist, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +2. If the subject has at least as many negative
levels as Hit Dice, it dies. If the subject survives and the negative
levels persist for 24 hours or longer, the subject must make another
Fortitude saving throw, or the negative levels are converted to actual
level loss.</p>
