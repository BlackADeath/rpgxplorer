      <p>A dorje is a slender crystal that contains a single power.
Each dorje has 50 charges when created, and each charge expended allows
one use of that power. A dorje that runs out of charges is just a
simple crystal.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical dorje is an elongated crystal of one color (or colorless),
between 8 inches and 10 inches long and about 1/2 inch thick, which can
weigh up to 1/4 pound. Occasionally, a dorje is decorated with carvings
or inscribed runes along a face of the crystal. A typical dorje has AC
7, 7 hit points, a hardness of 8, and a break DC of 18.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Dorjes use
the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a
dorje is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. (If the power being manifested has a manifesting time
longer than 1 standard action, however, it takes that long to manifest
the power from a dorje.) The user must have the power on his class
list, even if he knows the command thought. Additionally, to activate a
dorje, a character must hold it in hand and point it in the general
direction of the target or area to be affected.</p>

      
      <p>Dorjes are normally created at the minimum manifester level
required to manifest the power, and powers that can be augmented are
not augmented when stored in a dorje. A dorje&rsquo;s wielder cannot
augment the power contained within the dorje. However, dorjes can be
created at a higher manifester level than required to manifest the
power. In this case, the dorje that holds an augmentable power is
augmented, to the limit of the manifester level and the power&rsquo;s
augmentation maximums, if any. The manifester level of a dorje cannot
be more than five higher than the minimum manifester level to use the
power it contains.</p>
