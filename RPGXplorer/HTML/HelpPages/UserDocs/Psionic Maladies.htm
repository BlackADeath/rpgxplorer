      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Burn:</span> This is
a special form of ability damage that cannot be magically or
psionically healed. It is caused by the use of certain psionic feats
and powers. It returns only through natural healing.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disease, Cascade Flu:</span> Spread by brain moles and other vermin; injury; DC 13; incubation one day; damage psionic cascade.</p>
      <p>A psionic cascade is a loss of control over psionic abilities.
Using power points becomes dangerous for a character infected by
cascade flu, once the incubation period has run its course. Every time
an afflicted character manifests a power, she must make a DC 16
Concentration check. On a failed check, a psionic cascade is triggered.
The power operates normally, but during the following round, without
the character&rsquo;s volition, two additional powers she knows
manifest randomly, and their power cost is deducted from the
character&rsquo;s reserve. During the next round, three additional
powers manifest, and so on, until all the psionic character&rsquo;s
power points are drained. Powers with a range of personal or touch
always affect the diseased character. For other powers that affect
targets, roll d%: On a 01&ndash;50 result, the power affects the
diseased character, and 51&ndash;00 indicates that the power targets
other creatures in the vicinity. Psionic creatures (those that manifest
their powers without paying points) cascade until all the powers they
know have manifested at least twice.</p>
      <p>As with any disease, a psionic character who is injured or
attacked by a creature carrying a disease or parasite, or who otherwise
has contact with contaminated material, must make an immediate
Fortitude save. On a success, the disease fails to gain a foothold. On
a failure, the character takes damage (or incurs the specified effect)
after the incubation period. Once per day afterward, the afflicted
character must make a successful Fortitude save to avoid repeating the
damage. Two successful saving throws in a row indicate she has fought
off the disease.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disease, Cerebral Parasites: </span>Spread by contact with infected psionic creatures; contact; DC 15; incubation 1d4 days; damage 1d8 power points. </p>
      <p>Cerebral parasites are tiny organisms, undetectable to normal
sight. An afflicted character may not even know he carries the
parasites&mdash;until he discovers he has fewer power points for the
day than expected. Psionic creatures with cerebral parasites are
limited to using each of their known powers only once per day (instead
of freely manifesting them). See the note about diseases under Cascade
Flu, above.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Negative Levels:</span>
Psionic characters can gain negative levels just like members of other
character classes. A psionic character loses access to one power per
negative level from the highest level of power he can manifest; he also
loses a number of power points equal to the cost of that power. If two
or more powers fit these criteria, the manifester decides which one
becomes inaccessible. The lost power becomes available again as soon
the negative level is removed, providing the manifester is capable of
using it at that time. Lost power points also return.</p>
