      <p>Each of the monster entries describes a typical creature of
its kind. However, there are several methods by which extraordinary or
unique monsters can be created using a typical creature as the
foundation: by adding character classes, increasing a monster&rsquo;s
Hit Dice, or by adding a template to a monster. These methods are not
mutually exclusive - it&rsquo;s possible for a monster with a template
to be improved by both increasing its Hit Dice and adding character
class levels.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Class Levels:</span>
Intelligent creatures that are reasonably humanoid in shape most
commonly advance by adding class levels. Creatures that fall into this
category have an entry of &ldquo;By character class&rdquo; in their
Advancement line. When a monster adds a class level, that level usually
represents an increase in experience and learned skills and
capabilities.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Increased Hit Dice:</span>
Intelligent creatures that are not humanoid in shape, and
nonintelligent monsters, can advance by increasing their Hit Dice.
Creatures with increased Hit Dice are usually superior specimens of
their race, bigger and more powerful than their run-of-the-mill fellows.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Templates:</span> Both
intelligent and nonintelligent creatures with an unusual heritage or an
inflicted change in their essential nature may be modified with a
template. Templates usually result in tougher monsters with
capabilities that differ from those of their common kin.</p>
      <p>Each of these three methods for improving monsters is discussed in more detail below.</p>
