(DC 17). Factors: summon vermin mass instead of one creature (ad hoc +8
DC), grant damage reduction 1/epic (+15 DC), allow mass to move at your
speed (ad hoc +2 DC), perfect control of vermin (ad hoc +2 DC).
Mitigating factor: change range to personal (&ndash;2 DC). </p>

      
      <p>After casting crown of vermin, one thousand venomous, biting
and stinging spiders, scorpions, beetles, and centipedes erupt from the
very air around the character. This swarm forms a living aura around
the character to a radius of 10 feet. The character is immune to his or
her own crown of vermin. The swarm goes where the character goes at his
or her speed, even if the character takes to the air or water (though
water drowns the vermin after 1 full round of immersion, unless the
spell is cast underwater, in which case aquatic or marine vermin answer
the call and cannot leave the water). Each vermin in the crown of
vermin bites a creature who enters the area occupied by the effect (or
the character forces the effect into an area occupied by another
creature) for 1 point of damage, and then dies. Each victim takes
enough points of damage to kill it, destroying that number of vermin in
the process. Victims get a Reflex saving throw each round to avoid the
full press, and if successful, take only 10d10 bites (and 10d10 points
of damage). A total of 1,000 points of damage can be dealt to those who
fall prey to the crown of vermin. The vermin have damage reduction
1/epic, so the vermin&rsquo;s natural weapons are treated as epic for
the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If there aren&rsquo;t
enough vermin to kill all the creatures in the spell&rsquo;s effect,
the creature with the fewest hit points is affected first, then the
creature with the second fewest hit points, and so on. After all
creatures that can be killed have been killed, any remaining damage is
distributed among the survivors equally. </p>

      
      <p>The character has utter control over the vermin in his or her
aura, and can force them into areas that would normally deter common
vermin. The character can completely suppress his or her vermin aura as
a free action so that no vermin are visible at all. The time that
vermin are suppressed does not count toward the spell&rsquo;s duration.
Alternatively, the character can roughly shape and move the vermin in
any fashion he or she desires within the limits of the 10-foot-radius
spread as a move-equivalent action. The vermin cannot be wrested from
the character&rsquo;s control through any means. The vermin make all
saving throws to avoid damaging effects using the character&rsquo;s
base saving throw bonuses. They gain the character&rsquo;s spell
resistance, if any, and they get saving throws against spells that
would otherwise automatically slay vermin. A character can see through
his or her crown of vermin without difficulty, but gains one-half
concealment against enemy attacks launched both outside and within the
character&rsquo;s crown of vermin.&nbsp;</p>
