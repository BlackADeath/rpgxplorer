      <p>Spell resistance is the extraordinary ability to avoid being affected by spells. (Some spells also grant spell resistance.)</p>

      
      <p>To affect a creature that has spell resistance, a spellcaster
must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to
the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance. (The defender&rsquo;s spell
resistance is like an Armor Class against magical attacks.) If the
caster fails the check, the spell doesn&rsquo;t affect the creature.
The possessor does not have to do anything special to use spell
resistance. The creature need not even be aware of the threat for its
spell resistance to operate.</p>

      
      <p>Only spells and spell-like abilities are subject to spell
resistance. Extraordinary and supernatural abilities (including
enhancement bonuses on magic weapons) are not. A creature can have some
abilities that are subject to spell resistance and some that are not.
Even some spells ignore spell resistance; see When Spell Resistance
Applies, below.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>A creature can voluntarily lower its spell resistance. Doing
so is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
Once a creature lowers its resistance, it remains down until the
creature&rsquo;s next turn. At the beginning of the creature&rsquo;s
next turn, the creature&rsquo;s spell resistance automatically returns
unless the creature intentionally keeps it down (also a standard action
that does not provoke an attack of opportunity).</p>

      
      <p>A creature&rsquo;s spell resistance never interferes with its own spells, items, or abilities.</p>

      
      <p>A creature with spell resistance cannot impart this power to
others by touching them or standing in their midst. Only the rarest of
creatures and a few magic items have the ability to bestow spell
resistance upon another.<br>

Spell resistance does not stack. It overlaps.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">When Spell Resistance Applies: </span>Each
spell includes an entry that indicates whether spell resistance applies
to the spell. In general, whether spell resistance applies depends on
what the spell does:</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Targeted Spells:</span> Spell
resistance applies if the spell is targeted at the creature. Some
individually targeted spells can be directed at several creatures
simultaneously. In such cases, a creature&rsquo;s spell resistance
applies only to the portion of the spell actually targeted at that
creature. If several different resistant creatures are subjected to
such a spell, each checks its spell resistance separately.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Area Spells:</span> Spell
resistance applies if the resistant creature is within the
spell&rsquo;s area. It protects the resistant creature without
affecting the spell itself.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect Spells:</span> Most
effect spells summon or create something and are not subject to spell
resistance. Sometimes, however, spell resistance applies to effect
spells, usually to those that act upon a creature more or less
directly, such as web.</p>

      
      <p>Spell resistance can protect a creature from a spell
that&rsquo;s already been cast. Check spell resistance when the
creature is first affected by the spell.</p>

      
      <p>Check spell resistance only once for any particular casting of
a spell or use of a spell-like ability. If spell resistance fails the
first time, it fails each time the creature encounters that same
casting of the spell. Likewise, if the spell resistance succeeds the
first time, it always succeeds. If the creature has voluntarily lowered
its spell resistance and is then subjected to a spell, the creature
still has a single chance to resist that spell later, when its spell
resistance is up.</p>

      
      <p>Spell resistance has no effect unless the energy created or
released by the spell actually goes to work on the resistant
creature&rsquo;s mind or body. If the spell acts on anything else and
the creature is affected as a consequence, no roll is required.
Creatures can be harmed by a spell without being directly
affected.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>Spell resistance does not apply if an effect fools the creature&rsquo;s senses or reveals something about the creature.</p>

      
      <p>Magic actually has to be working for spell resistance to
apply. Spells that have instantaneous durations but lasting results
aren&rsquo;t subject to spell resistance unless the resistant creature
is exposed to the spell the instant it is cast.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>When in doubt about whether a spell&rsquo;s effect is direct or indirect, consider the spell&rsquo;s school:</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abjuration:</span> The target
creature must be harmed, changed, or restricted in some manner for
spell resistance to apply. Perception changes aren&rsquo;t subject to
spell resistance.</p>

      
      <p>Abjurations that block or negate attacks are not subject to an
attacker&rsquo;s spell resistance&mdash;it is the protected creature
that is affected by the spell (becoming immune or resistant to the
attack).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Conjuration:</span> These
spells are usually not subject to spell resistance unless the spell
conjures some form of energy. Spells that summon creatures or produce
effects that function like creatures are not subject to spell
resistance.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Divination:</span> These
spells do not affect creatures directly and are not subject to spell
resistance, even though what they reveal about a creature might be very
damaging.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enchantment:</span> Since enchantment spells affect creatures&rsquo; minds, they are typically subject to spell resistance.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Evocation: </span>If an
evocation spell deals damage to the creature, it has a direct effect.
If the spell damages something else, it has an indirect effect.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Illusion: </span>These spells are almost never subject to spell resistance. Illusions that entail a direct attack are exceptions.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Necromancy:</span> Most of
these spells alter the target creature&rsquo;s life force and are
subject to spell resistance. Unusual necromancy spells that don&rsquo;t
affect other creatures directly are not subject to spell resistance.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transmutation: </span>These
spells are subject to spell resistance if they transform the target
creature. Transmutation spells are not subject to spell resistance if
they are targeted on a point in space instead of on a creature. Some
transmutations make objects harmful (or more harmful), such as magic
stone. Even these spells are not generally subject to spell resistance
because they affect the objects, not the creatures against which the
objects are used. Spell resistance works against magic stone only if
the creature with spell resistance is holding the stones when the
cleric casts magic stone on them.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Successful Spell Resistance: </span>Spell resistance prevents a spell or a spell-like ability from
affecting or harming the resistant creature, but it never removes a
magical effect from another creature or negates a spell&rsquo;s effect
on another creature. Spell resistance prevents a spell from disrupting
another spell.</p>

      
      <p>Against an ongoing spell that has already been cast, a failed
check against spell resistance allows the resistant creature to ignore
any effect the spell might have. The magic continues to affect others
normally.&nbsp;</p>
