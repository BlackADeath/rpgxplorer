      <p>A staff is a long shaft of wood that stores several spells.
Unlike wands, which can contain a wide variety of spells, each staff is
of a certain kind and holds specific spells. A staff has 50 charges
when created.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description: </span>A
typical staff is 4 feet to 7 feet long and 2 inches to 3 inches thick,
weighing about 5 pounds. Most staffs are wood, but a rare few are bone,
metal, or even glass. (These are extremely exotic.) Staffs often have a
gem or some device at their tip or are shod in metal at one or both
ends. Staffs are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical
staff is like a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10
hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Staffs use
the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is
usually a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of
opportunity. (If the spell being cast, however, has a longer casting
time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to cast the spell from
a staff.) To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at
least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for nonhumanoid
creatures).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities:</span>
Roll d%. A 01&ndash;30 result indicates that something (a design,
inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff &rsquo;s
function, and 31&ndash;100 indicates no special qualities.&nbsp;</p>
