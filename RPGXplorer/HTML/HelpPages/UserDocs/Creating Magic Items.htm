      <p>To create magic items, spellcasters use special feats. They
invest time, money, and their own personal energy (in the form of
experience points) in an item&rsquo;s creation.</p>
      <p>Note that all items have prerequisites in their descriptions.
These prerequisites must be met for the item to be created. Most of the
time, they take the form of spells that must be known by the
item&rsquo;s creator (although access through another magic item or
spellcaster is allowed).</p>
      <p>While item creation costs are handled in detail below, note
that normally the two primary factors are the caster level of the
creator and the level of the spell or spells put into the item. A
creator can create an item at a lower caster level than her own, but
never lower than the minimum level needed to cast the needed spell.
Using metamagic feats, a caster can place spells in items at a higher
level than normal.</p>
      <p>Magic supplies for items are always half of the base price in
gp and 1/25 of the base price in XP. For many items, the market price
equals the base price.</p>
      <p>Armor, shields, weapons, and items with a value independent of
their magically enhanced properties add their item cost to the market
price. The item cost does not influence the base price (which
determines the cost of magic supplies and the experience point cost),
but it does increase the final market price.</p>
      <p>In addition, some items cast or replicate spells with costly
material components or with XP components. For these items, the market
price equals the base price plus an extra price for the spell component
costs. Each XP in the component costs adds 5 gp to the market price.
The cost to create these items is the magic supplies cost and the base
XP cost (both determined by the base price) plus the costs for the
components. Descriptions of these items include an entry that gives the
total cost of creating the item.</p>
      <p>The creator also needs a fairly quiet, comfortable, and
well-lit place in which to work. Any place suitable for preparing
spells is suitable for making items. Creating an item requires one day
per 1,000 gp in the item&rsquo;s base price, with a minimum of at least
one day. Potions are an exception to this rule; they always take just
one day to brew. The character must spend the gold and XP at the
beginning of the construction process.</p>
      <p>The caster works for 8 hours each day. He cannot rush the
process by working longer each day. But the days need not be
consecutive, and the caster can use the rest of his time as he sees fit.</p>
      <p>A character can work on only one item at a time. If a
character starts work on a new item, all materials used and XP spent on
the under-construction item are wasted.</p>
      <p>The secrets of creating artifacts are long lost.</p>
