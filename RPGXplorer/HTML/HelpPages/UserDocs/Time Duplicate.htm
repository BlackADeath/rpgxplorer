(to move future you back in time 1 round) (DC 27). Factors: move to
time stream (+8 DC), stretch the base temporal effect (ad hoc +8 DC),
quickened (+28 DC). </p>

      
      <p>The character snatches him or her self from 1 round in the
future, depositing this future self in an adjacent space as a free
action that counts as a quickened spell. The character&rsquo;s future
self is technically only a possible future self (the time stream is a
maelstrom of multiple probabilities), but snatching that future self
from 1 round in the future collapses probability, and the possible
future becomes the definite future. The character and his or her future
self are both free to act normally this round (the character has
already used up the limit of one quickened spell per round, but his or
her duplicate hasn&rsquo;t). The future self has all the resources the
character has at the moment he or she finishes casting time duplicate.
Because the future self was previously only a possibility, his or her
resources are not depleted as a result of whatever might occur this
round (even if the character dies this round). Likewise, he or she
doesn&rsquo;t have any special knowledge of what might occur during
this round. Because the future self is still part of the time stream,
the round it spends with the character is a round it misses in its own
future. Because the chracter&rsquo;s future duplicate is also the
character, the character misses the next round as well. He or she
simply isn&rsquo;t there. Tampering with the time stream is a tricky
business. Here is a round-by-round summary. </p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Round One:</span> The character casts time duplicate, the future self from round two arrives, and both act normally. </p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Round Two:</span> The future
self - the character - gets snatched back in time to help the past
self. During this round, there are no versions of the character
present. </p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Round Three:</span> The
character rejoins the time stream. The character arrives in the same
location and condition that the future self ended with at the end of
the first round. Any resources (spells, damage, staff charges) the
future self used up in round one are gone for real. Record them now.
Using this spell to snatch a single future self stretches time and
probability to its limit; more powerful versions of time duplicate are
not possible. A character cannot bring more than a single future
version of him or her self back at one time, nor can a character snatch
a version of him or her from farther in the future. </p>
