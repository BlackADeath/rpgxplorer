      <p>In the following sections, each type of psionic item, such as
armor or psionic tattoos, has a general description, followed by
descriptions of specific items.</p>
      <p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random
generation, and other information. The Armor Class, hardness, hit
points, and break DC are given for typical examples of some types of
psionic items. The Armor Class assumes that the item is unattended and
includes a &ndash;5 penalty for the item&rsquo;s effective Dexterity of
0. If a creature holds the item, use the creature&rsquo;s Dexterity
modifier as an adjustment to Armor Class in place of the &ndash;5
penalty.</p>
      <p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store psionic
powers, don&rsquo;t get full-blown descriptions. Simply reference the
power&rsquo;s description. Assume that the power is manifested at the
minimum level required to manifest it, unless otherwise noted.
Increasing the manifester level so increases the cost of the item; see
Table: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Value, substituting
&ldquo;spell&rdquo; for &ldquo;power&rdquo; and &ldquo;caster
level&rdquo; for &ldquo;manifester level&rdquo; as appropriate. The
main reason to make the manifester level higher, or course, would be to
increase the potency of the power. Raising the manifester level is
common for powers such as <span style="font-style: italic;">astral construct</span>, the duration of which increases with the level of the manifester.</p>
      <p>Items with full descriptions have their abilities detailed,
and each of the following aspects of these items is summarized at the
end of the description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Aura:</span> Most of the time, a <span style="font-style: italic;">detect psionics</span>
power will reveal the discipline associated with a psionic item and the
strength of the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable)
is given at the beginning of the item&rsquo;s notational entry in the
form of a phrase. See the <span style="font-style: italic;">detect psionics </span>power description for more information.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifester Level:</span> The
next entry in the summary indicates the level of the creator (or the
manifester level of the powers placed within the item, if this level is
lower than the actual level of the creator). The manifester level
provides the item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus, as well as range and
other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if variable).</p>
      <p>It also determines the level that must be contended with should the item come under the effect of a <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>
power or a similar situation. This information is given in the form
&ldquo;ML x,&rdquo; where &ldquo;ML&rdquo; is an abbreviation for
manifester</p>
      <p>level and &ldquo;x&rdquo; is an ordinal number representing the manifester level itself.</p>
      <p>For psionic tattoos, power stones, and dorjes, the creator can
set the manifester level of an item at any number high enough to
manifest the stored power and not higher than her own manifester level.
For other psionic items, the item itself determines the manifester
level. In this case, the creator&rsquo;s manifester level must be as
high as the item&rsquo;s manifester level (and prerequisites may
effectively put a higher minimum on the creator&rsquo;s level).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Certain
requirements must be met in order for a character to create a psionic
item. These include feats, powers, and miscellaneous requirements such
as level, alignment, and race or kind. The prerequisites for creation
of an item are given in the summary immediately following the
item&rsquo;s manifester level.</p>
      <p>A power prerequisite can be provided by a character who knows
the power, or through the use of a power completion or power trigger
psionic item or a psi-like ability that produces the desired power
effect. For each day that passes during the creation process, the
creator must expend one power completion item (such as a power stone)
or 1 charge from a power trigger item (such as a dorje), if either of
those objects is used to supply a prerequisite.</p>
      <p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the
creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the
prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary, such
as if one character knows some of the powers necessary to create an
item and another character knows the rest.</p>
      <p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they
must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the
purpose of determinations where the creator&rsquo;s level must be
known. (It&rsquo;s sensible, although not mandatory, for the
highest-level character involved to be considered the creator.) The
character designated as the creator pays the experience points required
to make the item.</p>
      <p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one
or more powers (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).
When two powers at the end of a list are separated by &ldquo;or,&rdquo;
one of those powers is required in addition to every other power
mentioned prior to the last two.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Market Price:</span> This
gold piece value, given in the summary following the word
&ldquo;Price,&rdquo; represents the price someone should expect to pay
to buy the item. Market prices are also included on the random
generation tables for easy reference. The market price of an item that
can be constructed with a psionic item creation feat is usually equal
to the base price + the price for any components (special materials or
experience point expenditure).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost to Create:</span> The
cost in gold pieces and experience points to create the item is given
in the summary following the word &ldquo;Cost.&rdquo; This information
appears only for items with components (material or experience points)
that make their market prices higher than their base prices. The cost
to create includes the costs derived from the base cost plus the cost
of the components. Items without components do not have a
&ldquo;Cost&rdquo; entry. For them, the market price and base price are
the same. The cost in gold pieces is 1/2 the market price, and the cost
in experience points is 1/25 the market price. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight:</span> The notational
entry for many items ends with a value for the item&rsquo;s weight.
When a weight figure is not given, the item has no weight worth noting
(for the purpose of determining how much of a load a character can
carry).</p>
