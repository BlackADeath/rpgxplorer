				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">You can make a bull rush as a
standard action (an attack) or as part of a charge (see Charge, below).
When you make a bull rush, you attempt to push an opponent straight
back instead of damaging him. You can only bull rush an opponent who is
one size category larger than you, the same size, or smaller.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Initiating a Bull Rush:</span>
First, you move into the defender&rsquo;s space. Doing this provokes an
attack of opportunity from each opponent that threatens you, including
the defender. (If you have the Improved Bull Rush feat, you don&rsquo;t
provoke an attack of opportunity from the defender.) Any attack of
opportunity made by anyone other than the defender against you during a
bull rush has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting the defender
instead, and any attack of opportunity by anyone other than you against
the defender likewise has a 25% chance of accidentally targeting you.
(When someone makes an attack of opportunity, make the attack roll and
then roll to see whether the attack went astray.) <br>
      <br>
Second, you and the defender make opposed Strength checks. You each add
a +4 bonus for each size category you are larger than Medium or a
&ndash;4 penalty for each size category you are smaller than Medium.
You get a +2 bonus if you are charging. The defender gets a +4 bonus if
he has more than two legs or is otherwise exceptionally stable.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bull Rush Results:</span> If you
beat the defender&rsquo;s Strength check result, you push him back 5
feet. If you wish to move with the defender, you can push him back an
additional 5 feet for each 5 points by which your check result is
greater than the defender&rsquo;s check result. You can&rsquo;t,
however, exceed your normal movement limit. (Note: The defender
provokes attacks of opportunity if he is moved. So do you, if you move
with him. The two of you do not provoke attacks of opportunity from
each other, however.)<br>
      <br>
If you fail to beat the defender&rsquo;s Strength check result, you
move 5 feet straight back to where you were before you moved into his
space. If that space is occupied, you fall prone in that space.</td>
