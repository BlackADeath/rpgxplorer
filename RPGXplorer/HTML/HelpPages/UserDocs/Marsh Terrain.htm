      </table>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bogs:</span> If a square is
part of a shallow bog, it has deep mud or standing water of about 1
foot in depth. It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square
with a shallow bog, and the DC of Tumble checks in such a square
increases by 2.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>A square that is part of a deep bog has roughly 4 feet of
standing water. It costs Medium or larger creatures 4 squares of
movement to move into a square with a deep bog, or characters can swim
if they wish. Small or smaller creatures must swim to move through a
deep bog. Tumbling is impossible in a deep bog.</p>

      
      <p>The water in a deep bog provides cover for Medium or larger
creatures. Smaller creatures gain improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4
bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or larger creatures can crouch as a move
action to gain this improved cover. Creatures with this improved cover
take a -10 penalty on attacks against creatures that aren&rsquo;t
underwater.<br>

Deep bog squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by an irregular ring of shallow bog squares.</p>

      
      <p>Both shallow and deep bogs increase the DC of Move Silently checks by 2.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Undergrowth:</span> The
bushes, rushes, and other tall grasses in marshes function as
undergrowth does in a forest (see above). A square that is part of a
bog does not also have undergrowth.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Quicksand:</span> Patches of
quicksand present a deceptively solid appearance (appearing as
undergrowth or open land) that may trap careless characters. A
character approaching a patch of quicksand at a normal pace is entitled
to a DC 8 Survival check to spot the danger before stepping in, but
charging or running characters don&rsquo;t have a chance to detect a
hidden bog before blundering in. A typical patch of quicksand is 20
feet in diameter; the momentum of a charging or running character
carries him or her 1d2&times;5 feet into the quicksand.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Effects of Quicksand: </span>Characters
in quicksand must make a DC 10 Swim check every round to simply tread
water in place, or a DC 15 Swim check to move 5 feet in whatever
direction is desired. If a trapped character fails this check by 5 or
more, he sinks below the surface and begins to drown whenever he can no
longer hold his breath (see the Swim skill description).</p>

      
      <p>Characters below the surface of a bog may swim back to the
surface with a successful Swim check (DC 15, +1 per consecutive round
of being under the surface).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rescue:</span> Pulling out a
character trapped in quicksand can be difficult. A rescuer needs a
branch, spear haft, rope, or similar tool that enables him to reach the
victim with one end of it. Then he must make a DC 15 Strength check to
successfully pull the victim, and the victim must make a DC 10 Strength
check to hold onto the branch, pole, or rope. If the victim fails to
hold on, he must make a DC 15 Swim check immediately to stay above the
surface. If both checks succeed, the victim is pulled 5 feet closer to
safety.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hedgerows:</span> Common in
moors, hedgerows are tangles of stones, soil, and thorny bushes. Narrow
hedgerows function as low walls, and it takes 15 feet of movement to
cross them. Wide hedgerows are more than 5 feet tall and take up entire
squares. They provide total cover, just as a wall does. It takes 4
squares of movement to move through a square with a wide hedgerow;
creatures that succeed on a DC 10 Climb check need only 2 squares of
movement to move through the square.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Marsh Terrain Elements:</span>
Some marshes, particularly swamps, have trees just as forests do,
usually clustered in small stands. Paths lead across many marshes,
winding to avoid bog areas. As in forests, paths allow normal movement
and don&rsquo;t provide the concealment that undergrowth does.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stealth and Detection in a Marsh:</span>
In a moor, the maximum distance at which a Spot check for detecting the
nearby presence of others can succeed is 6d6&times;10 feet. In a swamp,
this distance is 2d8&times;10 feet.</p>

      
      <p>Undergrowth and deep bogs provide plentiful concealment, so it&rsquo;s easy to hide in a marsh.</p>

      
      <p>A marsh imposes no penalties on Listen checks, and using the Move Silently skill is more difficult in both undergrowth and bogs.
