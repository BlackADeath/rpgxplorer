      <p>When attempting to break an object, you have two choices: smash it with a weapon or break it with sheer strength.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Smashing an Object</span><br>
Smashing a weapon or shield with a slashing or bludgeoning weapon is
accomplished by the sunder special attack. Smashing an object is a lot
like sundering a weapon or shield, except that your attack roll is
opposed by the object&rsquo;s AC. Generally, you can smash an object
only with a bludgeoning or slashing weapon.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> Objects
are easier to hit than creatures because they usually don&rsquo;t move,
but many are tough enough to shrug off some damage from each blow. An
object&rsquo;s Armor Class is equal to 10 + its size modifier + its
Dexterity modifier. An inanimate object has not only a Dexterity of 0
(-5 penalty to AC), but also an additional -2 penalty to its AC.
Furthermore, if you take a full-round action to line up a shot, you get
an automatic hit with a melee weapon and a +5 bonus on attack rolls
with a ranged weapon.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hardness:</span> Each object
has hardness-a number that represents how well it resists damage.
Whenever an object takes damage, subtract its hardness from the damage.
Only damage in excess of its hardness is deducted from the
object&rsquo;s hit points (see Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield
Hardness and Hit Points; Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points; and
Table: Object Hardness and Hit Points).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Points:</span> An
object&rsquo;s hit point total depends on what it is made of and how
big it is (see Table: Common Armor, Weapon, and Shield Hardness and Hit
Points; Table: Substance Hardness and Hit Points; and Table: Object
Hardness and Hit Points). When an object&rsquo;s hit points reach 0,
it&rsquo;s ruined.</p>
      <p>Very large objects have separate hit point totals for different sections.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Energy Attacks:</span> Acid
and sonic attacks deal damage to most objects just as they do to
creatures; roll damage and apply it normally after a successful hit.
Electricity and fire attacks deal half damage to most objects; divide
the damage dealt by 2 before applying the hardness. Cold attacks deal
one-quarter damage to most objects; divide the damage dealt by 4 before
applying the hardness.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ranged Weapon Damage:</span>
Objects take half damage from ranged weapons (unless the weapon is a
siege engine or something similar). Divide the damage dealt by 2 before
applying the object&rsquo;s hardness.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ineffective Weapons:</span> Certain weapons just can&rsquo;t effectively deal damage to certain objects.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Immunities: </span>Objects are immune to nonlethal damage and to critical hits.</p>
      <p>Even animated objects, which are otherwise considered creatures, have these immunities because they are constructs.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Magic Armor, Shields, and Weapons:</span> Each +1 of enhancement bonus adds 2 to the hardness of armor, a weapon, or a shield and +10 to the item&rsquo;s hit points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Vulnerability to Certain Attacks:</span>
Certain attacks are especially successful against some objects. In such
cases, attacks deal double their normal damage and may ignore the
object&rsquo;s hardness.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Damaged Objects: </span>A damaged object remains fully functional until the item&rsquo;s hit points are reduced to 0, at which point it is destroyed.</p>
      <p>Damaged (but not destroyed) objects can be repaired with the Craft skill.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throws: </span>Nonmagical,
unattended items never make saving throws. They are considered to have
failed their saving throws, so they always are affected by spells. An
item attended by a character (being grasped, touched, or worn) makes
saving throws as the character (that is, using the character&rsquo;s
saving throw bonus).</p>
      <p>Magic items always get saving throws. A magic item&rsquo;s
Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save bonuses are equal to 2 + one-half its
caster level. An attended magic item either makes saving throws as its
owner or uses its own saving throw bonus, whichever is better.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Animated Objects:</span> Animated objects count as creatures for purposes of determining their Armor Class (do not treat them as inanimate objects).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Breaking Items</span><br>
When a character tries to break something with sudden force rather than
by dealing damage, use a Strength check (rather than an attack roll and
damage roll, as with the sunder special attack) to see whether he or
she succeeds. The DC depends more on the construction of the item than
on the material.</p>
      <p>If an item has lost half or more of its hit points, the DC to break it drops by 2.</p>
      <p>Larger and smaller creatures get size bonuses and size
penalties on Strength checks to break open doors as follows: Fine -16,
Diminutive -12, Tiny -8, Small -4, Large +4, Huge +8, Gargantuan +12,
Colossal +16.</p>
      <p>A crowbar or portable ram improves a character&rsquo;s chance of breaking open a door.<br>
