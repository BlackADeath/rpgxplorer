      <p>This section describes each skill, including common uses and
typical modifiers. Characters can sometimes use skills for purposes
other than those noted here.<br>
Here is the format for skill descriptions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill Name: </span>The skill name line includes (in addition to the name of the skill) the following information.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Key Ability:</span> The
abbreviation of the ability whose modifier applies to the skill check.
Exception: Speak Language has &ldquo;None&rdquo; as its key ability
because the use of this skill does not require a check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trained Only:</span> If this
notation is included in the skill name line, you must have at least 1
rank in the skill to use it. If it is omitted, the skill can be used
untrained (with a rank of 0). If any special notes apply to trained or
untrained use, they are covered in the Untrained section (see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Check Penalty:</span>
If this notation is included in the skill name line, an armor check
penalty applies (when appropriate) to checks using this skill. If this
entry is absent, an armor check penalty does not apply.</p>
      <p>The skill name line is followed by a general description of
what using the skill represents. After the description are a few other
types of information:</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check:</span> What a character (&ldquo;you&rdquo; in the skill description) can do with a successful skill check and the check&rsquo;s DC.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Action:</span> The type of action using the skill requires, or the amount of time required for a check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try Again:</span> Any
conditions that apply to successive attempts to use the skill
successfully. If the skill doesn&rsquo;t allow you to attempt the same
task more than once, or if failure carries an inherent penalty (such as
with the Climb skill), you can&rsquo;t take 20. If this paragraph is
omitted, the skill can be retried without any inherent penalty, other
than the additional time required.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> Any extra
facts that apply to the skill, such as special effects deriving from
its use or bonuses that certain characters receive because of class,
feat choices, or race.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synergy:</span> Some skills
grant a bonus to the use of one or more other skills because of a
synergistic effect. This entry, when present, indicates what bonuses
this skill may grant or receive because of such synergies. See Table
4&ndash;5 for a complete list of bonuses granted by synergy between
skills (or between a skill and a class feature).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Restriction: </span>The full
utility of certain skills is restricted to characters of certain
classes or characters who possess certain feats. This entry indicates
whether any such restrictions exist for the skill.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Untrained:</span> This entry
indicates what a character without at least 1 rank in the skill can do
with it. If this entry doesn&rsquo;t appear, it means that the skill
functions normally for untrained characters (if it can be used
untrained) or that an untrained character can&rsquo;t attempt checks
with this skill (for skills that are designated as &ldquo;Trained
Only&rdquo;).
