      <p>Most psionic monsters have some number of psi-like abilities.
These are very similar to spell-like abilities. Naturally, they are
psionic and work just like powers or spells. A creature with psi-like
abilities does not pay for these abilities with power points and does
not pay any XP cost associated with manifesting the power the ability
duplicates.</p>
      <p>Psi-like abilities do not work in a null psionics field and
are subject to power resistance if the power or spell the ability
duplicates would be subject to power resistance. A psi-like ability
usually has a limit on how often it can be used. A psi-like ability
that can be used at will has no use limit. Using a psi-like ability is
a standard action unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened
provokes attacks of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration
check to use a psi-like ability defensively and avoid provoking attacks
of opportunity, just as when using a power or casting a spell. A
psi-like ability can be interrupted just as a spell can be. Psi-like
abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be
counterspelled.</p>
      <p>All creatures with psi-like abilities are assigned a
manifester level, which indicates how difficult it is to dispel their
psi-like effects and determines all level-dependent variables (such as
range or duration) the abilities might have. When a creature uses a
psi-like ability, the power is manifested as if the creature had spent
a number of power points equal to its manifester level, which may
augment the power to improve its damage or save DC. However, the
creature does not actually spend power points for its psi-like
abilities, even if it has a power point reserve due to racial
abilities, class levels, or some other psionic ability.</p>
      <p>The DC of a saving throw (if applicable) against a
creature&rsquo;s psi-like ability is 10 + the level of the power or
spell the ability duplicates + the creature&rsquo;s Cha modifier.
Remember to check the power&rsquo;s Augment entry to see if the
creature&rsquo;s manifester level (and thus the effective power point
expenditure) increases the DC of the saving throw. Changes to the
effect&rsquo;s save DC, damage, and so on are noted in the psi-like
ability entry.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psionic Focus: </span>Some
creatures have feats that can be used only when the creature is
psionically focused, or that require the creature to expend its psionic
focus. Assume that such a creature is psionically focused before
entering combat.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psi-Like Abilities and Feats: </span>Creatures with access to psi-like abilities can use the feats Empower Spell-Like Ability and Quicken Spell-Like Ability.</p>
      <p>These feats can be used only on psi-like abilities that do not
have increased effects due to augmentation. Furthermore, the creature
can empower only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to
half its manifester level (round down) minus 2, and can quicken only a
psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half its manifester
level (round down) minus 4.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creatures with &ldquo;Psionics&rdquo; Entries: </span>Psionic
monsters often possess spell-like abilities that are identified as
&ldquo;psionics,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;spell-like abilities.&rdquo;
For all intents and purposes, creatures with spell-like abilities
described as psionics are considered to possess psi-like abilities, and
they manifest their powers as described above.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psionic Spells:</span> In
some cases, a creature&rsquo;s psi-like abilities (or abilities listed
under a creature&rsquo;s psionics entry) may include an effect that
does not duplicate any listed power. For such abilities, simply use the
existing spell description. Treat the creature&rsquo;s manifester level
as the caster level for the spell. The ability is still psionic in
origin, so spells and powers that specifically affect psionic powers
can negate or reduce its effects as they would any other psionic power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psionic Versions Of Creatures:</span>
Below are presented psionic versions of the following creatures:
aboleth, couatl, and duergar,. These alternate versions are psionic
equivalents of their standard counterparts.</p>
      <p>Only the portions of the monster entry that are specifically
changed by the addition of psionics rules have been listed.&nbsp; All
other elements of the creature remain the same.</p>
