      <p>The planes of existence are different realities with
interwoven connections. Except for rare linking points, each plane is
effectively its own universe with its own natural laws. <br>

The planes break down into a number of general types: the Material
Plane, the Transitive Planes, the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, and
the demiplanes.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Material Plane:</span> The
Material Plane tends to be the most Earthlike of all planes and
operates under the same set of natural laws that our own real world
does. This is the default plane for most adventures.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transitive Planes:</span>
These three planes have one important common characteristic: Each is
used to get from one place to another. The Astral Plane is a conduit to
all other planes, while the Ethereal Plane and the Plane of Shadow both
serve as means of transportation within the Material Plane
they&rsquo;re connected to. These planes have the strongest regular
interaction with the Material Plane and are often accessed by using
various spells. They have native inhabitants as well.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Inner Planes:</span> These
six planes are manifestations of the basic building blocks of the
universe. Each is made up of a single type of energy or element that
overwhelms all others. The natives of a particular Inner Plane are made
of the same energy or element as the plane itself.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Outer Planes: </span>The
deities live on the Outer Planes, as do creatures such as celestials,
demons, and devils. Each of the Outer Planes has an alignment,
representing a particular moral or ethical outlook, and the natives of
each plane tend to behave in agreement with that plane&rsquo;s
alignment. The Outer Planes are also the final resting place of souls
from the Material Plane, whether that final rest takes the form of calm
introspection or eternal damnation.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demiplanes:</span> This
catch-all category covers all extradimensional spaces that function
like planes but have measurable size and limited access. Other kinds of
planes are theoretically infinite in size, but a demiplane might be
only a few hundred feet across.
