      <p>There are many ways to get lost in the wilderness. Following
an obvious road, trail, or feature such as a stream or shoreline
prevents any possibility of becoming lost, but travelers striking off
cross-country may become disoriented-especially in conditions of poor
visibility or in difficult terrain.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Poor Visibility:</span> Any
time characters cannot see at least 60 feet in the prevailing
conditions of visibility, they may become lost. Characters traveling
through fog, snow, or a downpour might easily lose the ability to see
any landmarks not in their immediate vicinity. Similarly, characters
traveling at night may be at risk, too, depending on the quality of
their light sources, the amount of moonlight, and whether they have
darkvision or lowlight vision.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult Terrain:</span> Any
character in forest, moor, hill, or mountain terrain may become lost if
he or she moves away from a trail, road, stream, or other obvious path
or track. Forests are especially dangerous because they obscure far-off
landmarks and make it hard to see the sun or stars.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chance to Get Lost:</span> If
conditions exist that make getting lost a possibility, the character
leading the way must succeed on a Survival check or become lost. The
difficulty of this check varies based on the terrain, the visibility
conditions, and whether or not the character has a map of the area
being traveled through. Refer to the table below and use the highest DC
that applies.</p>

      <p>A character with at least 5 ranks in Knowledge (geography) or
Knowledge (local) pertaining to the area being traveled through gains a
+2 bonus on this check.</p>

      
      <p>Check once per hour (or portion of an hour) spent in local or
overland movement to see if travelers have become lost. In the case of
a party moving together, only the character leading the way makes the
check.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effects of Being Lost:</span>
If a party becomes lost, it is no longer certain of moving in the
direction it intended to travel. Randomly determine the direction in
which the party actually travels during each hour of local or overland
movement. The characters&rsquo; movement continues to be random until
they blunder into a landmark they can&rsquo;t miss, or until they
recognize that they are lost and make an effort to regain their
bearings.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Recognizing that You&rsquo;re Lost:</span>
Once per hour of random travel, each character in the party may attempt
a Survival check (DC 20, -1 per hour of random travel) to recognize
that they are no longer certain of their direction of travel. Some
circumstances may make it obvious that the characters are lost.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Setting a New Course:</span>
A lost party is also uncertain of determining in which direction it
should travel in order to reach a desired objective. Determining the
correct direction of travel once a party has become lost requires a
Survival check (DC 15, +2 per hour of random travel). If a character
fails this check, he chooses a random direction as the
&ldquo;correct&rdquo; direction for resuming travel.</p>

      
      <p>Once the characters are traveling along their new course,
correct or incorrect, they may get lost again. If the conditions still
make it possible for travelers to become lost, check once per hour of
travel as described in Chance to Get Lost, above, to see if the party
maintains its new course or begins to move at random again.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Conflicting Directions:</span>
It&rsquo;s possible that several characters may attempt to determine
the right direction to proceed after becoming lost. Make a Survival
check for each character in secret, then tell the players whose
characters succeeded the correct direction in which to travel, and tell
the players whose characters failed a random direction they think is
right.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regaining Your Bearings:</span>
There are several ways to become un-lost. First, if the characters
successfully set a new course and follow it to the destination
they&rsquo;re trying to reach, they&rsquo;re not lost anymore. Second,
the characters through random movement might run into an unmistakable
landmark. Third, if conditions suddenly improve-the fog lifts or the
sun comes up-lost characters may attempt to set a new course, as
described above, with a +4 bonus on the Survival check. Finally, magic
may make their course clear.</p>
