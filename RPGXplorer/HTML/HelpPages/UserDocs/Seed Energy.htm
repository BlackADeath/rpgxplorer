      <p>Evocation [Acid, Fire, Electricity, Cold, or Sonic]<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spellcraft DC:</span> 19<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Components:</span> V, S<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time:</span> 1 minute<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 300 ft. or touched creature or object of 2,000 lb. or less<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> A bolt 5 ft.
wide to 300 ft. long; or a 10-ft.-radius emanation; or a wall whose
area is up to one 200-ft. square; or a sphere or hemi-sphere with a
radius of up to 20 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> Instantaneous or 20 hours (see text)<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Resistance:</span> Yes </p>

      
      <p>This seed uses whichever one of five energy types the caster
chooses: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The caster can cast
the energy forth as a bolt, imbue an object with the energy, or create
a freestanding manifestation of the energy. If the spell developed
using the energy seed releases a bolt, that bolt instantaneously deals
10d6 points of damage of the appropriate energy type, and all in the
bolt&rsquo;s area must make a Reflex save for half damage. For each
additional 1d6 points of damage dealt, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+2. The bolt begins at the caster&rsquo;s fingertips. To imbue another
creature with the ability to use an energy bolt as a spell-like ability
at its option or when a particular condition is met, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +25. The caster can also cause a creature or object to
emanate the specific energy type out to a radius of 10 feet for 20
hours. The emanated energy deals 2d6 points of energy damage per round
against unprotected creatures (the target creature is susceptible if
not separately warded or otherwise resistant to the energy). For each
additional 1d6 points of damage emanated, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+2. The caster may also create a wall, half-circle, circle, dome, or
sphere of the desired energy that emanates the energy for up to 20
hours. One side of the wall, selected by the caster, sends forth waves
of energy, dealing 2d4 points of energy damage to creatures within 10
feet and 1d4 points of energy damage to those past 10 feet but within
20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and in each round
that a creature enters or remains in the area. In addition, the wall
deals 2d6+20 points of energy damage to any creature passing through
it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures. For each
additional 1d4 points of damage, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p>

      
      <p>The caster can also use the energy seed to create a spell that
carefully releases and balances the emanation of cold, electricity, and
fire, creating specific weather effects for a period of 20 hours. Using
the energy seed this way has a base Spellcraft DC of 25. The area
extends to a two-mile-radius centered on the caster. Once the spell is
cast, the weather takes 10 minutes to manifest. Ordinarily, a caster
can&rsquo;t directly target a creature or object, though indirect
effects are possible. This seed can create cold snaps, heat waves,
thunderstorms, fogs, blizzards - even a tornado that moves randomly in
the affected area. Creating targeted damaging effects requires an
additional use of the energy seed. </p>
