      <p>A lawful evil villain methodically takes what he wants within
the limits of his code of conduct without regard for whom it hurts. He
cares about tradition, loyalty, and order but not about freedom,
dignity, or life. He plays by the rules but without mercy or
compassion. He is comfortable in a hierarchy and would like to rule,
but is willing to serve. He condemns others not according to their
actions but according to race, religion, homeland, or social rank. He
is loath to break laws or promises.</p>
      <p>This reluctance comes partly from his nature and partly
because he depends on order to protect himself from those who oppose
him on moral grounds. Some lawful evil villains have particular taboos,
such as not killing in cold blood (but having underlings do it) or not
letting children come to harm (if it can be helped). They imagine that
these compunctions put them above unprincipled villains.</p>
      <p>Some lawful evil people and creatures commit themselves to
evil with a zeal like that of a crusader committed to good. Beyond
being willing to hurt others for their own ends, they take pleasure in
spreading evil as an end unto itself. They may also see doing evil as
part of a duty to an evil deity or master.<br>
Lawful evil is sometimes called &ldquo;diabolical,&rdquo; because devils are the epitome of lawful evil.</p>
      <p>Lawful evil is the most dangerous alignment because it represents methodical, intentional, and frequently successful evil.
