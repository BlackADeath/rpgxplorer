      <p>Here is the format for salient divine ability descriptions.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Name</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisite:</span> A
minimum divine rank, minimum ability score, another salient divine
ability, a minimum base attack bonus, a feat, a skill, or some other
condition that a deity must have in order to acquire this salient
divine ability. This entry is absent if a salient divine ability has no
prerequisite. An ability may have more than one prerequisite. All
salient divine abilities have a minimum prerequisite of divine rank 1.
Quasi-deities (rank 0) have no salient divine abilities.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> What the
ability enables the deity to do. If a deity has the same ability more
than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the
description. In general, having a salient divine ability twice is the
same as having it once.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span> Additional facts about the ability that may be helpful when using the ability in play.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rest:</span> Some abilities
require the deity to rest afterward. If no rest is required, the entry
is absent. A resting deity can engage in light activities such as
talking or walking at half speed. When attempting anything more
strenuous than that, the deity can only take partial actions and
suffers a &ndash;6 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. The
deity cannot use another ability that requires rest until its current
rest requirement is fulfilled. Any time the deity spends performing
strenuous activities does not count toward the required rest time.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggested Portfolio Elements: </span>This
entry gives one or more portfolio elements that are associated with the
salient divine ability in question. The information is provided as
guidance and should not be taken as a rule.&nbsp;</p>
