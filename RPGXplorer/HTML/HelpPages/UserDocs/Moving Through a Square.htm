      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Friend:</span> You can move
through a square occupied by a friendly character, unless you are
charging. When you move through a square occupied by a friendly
character, that character doesn&rsquo;t provide you with cover.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Opponent:</span> You
can&rsquo;t move through a square occupied by an opponent, unless the
opponent is helpless. You can move through a square occupied by a
helpless opponent without penalty. (Some creatures, particularly very
large ones, may present an obstacle even when helpless. In such cases,
each square you move through counts as 2 squares.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ending Your Movement: </span>You can&rsquo;t end your movement in the same square as another creature unless it is helpless.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Overrun: </span>During your movement you can attempt to move through a square occupied by an opponent.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tumbling:</span> A trained character can attempt to tumble through a square occupied by an opponent (see the Tumble skill).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Very Small Creature:</span> A
Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creature can move into or through an occupied
square. The creature provokes attacks of opportunity when doing so.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Square Occupied by Creature Three Sizes Larger or Smaller:</span> Any creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories larger than it is.</p>
      <p>A big creature can move through a square occupied by a creature three size categories smaller than it is.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Designated Exceptions:</span>
Some creatures break the above rules. A creature that completely fills
the squares it occupies cannot be moved past, even with the Tumble
skill or similar special abilities.
