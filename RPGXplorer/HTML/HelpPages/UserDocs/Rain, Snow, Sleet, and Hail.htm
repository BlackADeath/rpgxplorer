      <p>Bad weather frequently slows or halts travel and makes it
virtually impossible to navigate from one spot to another. Torrential
downpours and blizzards obscure vision as effectively as a dense fog.</p>
      <p>Most precipitation is rain, but in cold conditions it can
manifest as snow, sleet, or hail. Precipitation of any kind followed by
a cold snap in which the temperature dips from above freezing to
30&deg; F or below may produce ice.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rain:</span> Rain reduces
visibility ranges by half, resulting in a -4 penalty on Spot and Search
checks. It has the same effect on flames, ranged weapon attacks, and
Listen checks as severe wind.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Snow:</span> Falling snow
has the same effects on visibility, ranged weapon attacks, and skill
checks as rain, and it costs 2 squares of movement to enter a
snow-covered square. A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the
ground.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heavy Snow:</span> Heavy
snow has the same effects as normal snowfall, but also restricts
visibility as fog does (see Fog, below). A day of heavy snow leaves 1d4
feet of snow on the ground, and it costs 4 squares of movement to enter
a square covered with heavy snow. Heavy snow accompanied by strong or
severe winds may result in snowdrifts 1d4&times;5 feet deep, especially
in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind-a cabin or a large
tent, for instance. There is a 10% chance that a heavy snowfall is
accompanied by lightning (see Thunderstorm, below). Snow has the same
effect on flames as moderate wind.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sleet:</span> Essentially
frozen rain, sleet has the same effect as rain while falling (except
that its chance to extinguish protected flames is 75%) and the same
effect as snow once on the ground.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hail:</span> Hail does not
reduce visibility, but the sound of falling hail makes Listen checks
more difficult (-4 penalty). Sometimes (5% chance) hail can become
large enough to deal 1 point of lethal damage (per storm) to anything
in the open. Once on the ground, hail has the same effect on movement
as snow.
