      <p>Each general type of magic item gets an overall description, followed by descriptions of specific items.</p>
      <p>General descriptions include notes on activation, random
generation, and other material. The AC, hardness, hit points, and break
DC are given for typical examples of some magic items. The AC assumes
that the item is unattended and includes a &ndash;5 penalty for the
item&rsquo;s effective Dexterity of 0. If a creature holds the item,
use the creature&rsquo;s Dexterity modifier in place of the &ndash;5
penalty.</p>
      <p>Some individual items, notably those that simply store spells
and nothing else, don&rsquo;t get full-blown descriptions. Reference
the spell&rsquo;s description for details, modified by the form of the
item (potion, scroll, wand, and so on). Assume that the spell is cast
at the minimum level required to cast it.</p>
      <p>Items with full descriptions have their powers detailed, and
each of the following topics is covered in notational form at the end
of the description.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aura: Most of the time, a detect magic spell will reveal
the school of magic associated with a magic item and the strength of
the aura an item emits. This information (when applicable) is given at
the beginning of the item&rsquo;s notational entry. See the detect
magic spell description for details.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Caster Level: The next item in a notational entry gives the
caster level of the item, indicating its relative power. The caster
level determines the item&rsquo;s saving throw bonus, as well as range
or other level-dependent aspects of the powers of the item (if
variable). It also determines the level that must be contended with
should the item come under the effect of a dispel magic spell or
similar situation. This information is given in the form &ldquo;CL
x,&rdquo; where &ldquo;CL&rdquo; is an abbreviation for caster level
and &ldquo;x&rdquo; is an ordinal number representing the caster level
itself.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>For potions, scrolls, and wands, the creator can set the
caster level of an item at any number high enough to cast the stored
spell and not higher than her own caster level. For other magic items,
the caster level is determined by the item itself. In this case, the
creator&rsquo;s caster level must be as high as the item&rsquo;s caster
level (and prerequisites may effectively put a higher minimum on the
creator&rsquo;s level).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Prerequisites: Certain requirements must be met in order
for a character to create a magic item. These include feats, spells,
and miscellaneous requirements such as level, alignment, and race or
kind. The prerequisites for creation of an item are given immediately
following the item&rsquo;s caster level.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A spell prerequisite may be provided by a character who has
prepared the spell (or who knows the spell, in the case of a sorcerer
or bard), or through the use of a spell completion or spell trigger
magic item or a spell-like ability that produces the desired spell
effect. For each day that passes in the creation process, the creator
must expend one spell completion item or one charge from a spell
trigger item if either of those objects is used to supply a
prerequisite.</p>
      <p>It is possible for more than one character to cooperate in the
creation of an item, with each participant providing one or more of the
prerequisites. In some cases, cooperation may even be necessary.</p>
      <p>If two or more characters cooperate to create an item, they
must agree among themselves who will be considered the creator for the
purpose of determinations where the creator&rsquo;s level must be
known. The character designated as the creator pays the XP required to
make the item.</p>
      <p>Typically, a list of prerequisites includes one feat and one or more spells (or some other requirement in addition to the feat).</p>
      <p>When two spells at the end of a list are separated by
&ldquo;or,&rdquo; one of those spells is required in addition to every
other spell mentioned prior to the last two.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Market Price: This gold piece value, given following the
word &ldquo;Price,&rdquo; represents the price someone should expect to
pay to buy the item. The market price for an item that can be
constructed with an item creation feat is usually equal to the base
price plus the price for any components (material or XP).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Cost to Create: The next part of a notational entry is the cost in gp and XP to create the item, given following the word.</li>
      </ul>
"Cost.&rdquo; This information appears only for items with components
(material or XP), which make their market prices higher than their base
prices. The cost to create includes the costs derived from the base
cost plus the costs of the components.
      <p>Items without components do not have a &ldquo;Cost&rdquo;
entry. For them, the market price and the base price are the same. The
cost in gp is 1/2 the market price, and the cost in XP is 1/25 the
market price.<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Weight: The notational entry for many wondrous items ends
with a value for the item&rsquo;s weight. When a weight figure is not
given, the item has no weight worth noting (for purposes of determining
how much of a load a character can carry).&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
