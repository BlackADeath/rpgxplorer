					<P>Spells, magic items, and certain monsters can affect characters with
					  fear. In most cases, the character makes a Will saving throw to resist
					  this effect, and a failed roll means that the character is shaken, frightened,
				  or panicked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </P>
					<P><strong>Shaken:</strong> Characters who are shaken take a &#8211;2 penalty on attack rolls,
				  saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.</P>
					<P><strong>Frightened:</strong> Characters who are frightened are shaken,
					    and in addition they flee from the source of their fear as
					    quickly as they can. They can choose the path of their
					    flight. Other than that stipulation,
					    once they are out of sight (or hearing) of the source
					    of their fear, they can act as they want. However, if the duration of
					    their
					    fear continues,
					    characters can be forced to flee once more if the source
					    of their fear presents itself again. Characters unable
					    to flee can fight (though they
				    are still shaken).</P>
					<P><strong>Panicked: </strong>Characters who are panicked are shaken, and
					    they run away from the source of their fear as quickly as they
					    can. Other than running away from the source, their path
					    is random. They flee from all
					    other dangers that confront them rather than facing those
				    dangers. Panicked characters cower if they are prevented
					    from fleeing.</P>
					<P><strong>Becoming Even More Fearful: </strong>Fear effects are cumulative.
					    A shaken character who is made shaken again becomes frightened,
					    and a shaken character who is made frightened becomes
					    panicked instead. A frightened
					    character who is made shaken or frightened becomes panicked
					    instead.<br>
