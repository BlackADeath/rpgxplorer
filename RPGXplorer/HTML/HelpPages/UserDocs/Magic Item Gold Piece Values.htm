      <p>Many factors must be considered when determining the price of
new magic items. The easiest way to come up with a price is to match
the new item to an item that is already priced that price as a guide.
Otherwise, use the guidelines summarized on Table: Estimating Magic
Item Gold Piece Values.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Similar Abilities:</span>
For items with multiple similar abilities that don&rsquo;t take up
space on a character&rsquo;s body use the following formula: Calculate
the price of the single most costly ability, then add 75% of the value
of the next most costly ability, plus one-half the value of any other
abilities.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Different Abilities:</span>
Abilities such as an attack roll bonus or saving throw bonus and a
spell-like function are not similar, and their values are simply added
together to determine the cost. For items that do take up a space on a
character&rsquo;s body each additional power not only has no discount
but instead has a 50% increase in price.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">0-Level Spells:</span> When multiplying spell levels to determine value, 0- level spells should be treated as 1/2 level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Considerations:</span> Once you have a final cost figure, reduce that number if either of the following conditions applies:</p>
      <p>&mdash;<span style="font-style: italic;">Item Requires Skill to Use: </span>Some items require a specific skill to get them to function. This factor should reduce the cost about 10%.<br>
&mdash;<span style="font-style: italic;">Item Requires Specific Class or Alignment to Use:</span> Even more restrictive than requiring a skill, this limitation cuts the cost by 30%.</p>
      <p>Prices presented in the magic item descriptions (the gold
piece value following the item&rsquo;s caster level) are the market
value, which is generally twice what it costs the creator to make the
item.</p>
      <p>Since different classes get access to certain spells at
different levels, the prices for two characters to make the same item
might actually be different. An item is only worth two times what the
caster of lowest possible level can make it for. Calculate the market
price based on the lowest possible level caster, no matter who makes
the item.</p>
      <p>Not all items adhere to these formulas directly. The reasons
for this are several. First and foremost, these few formulas
aren&rsquo;t enough to truly gauge the exact differences between items.
The price of a magic item may be modified based on its actual worth.
The formulas only provide a starting point. The pricing of scrolls
assumes that, whenever possible, a wizard or cleric created it. Potions
and wands follow the formulas exactly. Staffs follow the formulas
closely, and other items require at least some judgment calls.</p>
