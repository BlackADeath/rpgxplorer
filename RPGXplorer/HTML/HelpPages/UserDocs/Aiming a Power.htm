				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">
      <p>You must make some choice about whom the power is to affect or
where the power&rsquo;s effect is to originate, depending on the type
of power. The next entry in a power description defines the
power&rsquo;s target (or targets), its effect, or its area, as
appropriate.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target or Targets:</span>
Some powers have a target or targets. You manifest these powers on
creatures or objects, as defined by the power itself. You must be able
to see or touch the target, and you must specifically choose that
target. However, you do not have to select your target until you finish
manifesting the power.</p>
      <p>If you manifest a targeted power on the wrong type of target
the power has no effect. If the target of a power is yourself (the
power description has a line that reads &ldquo;Target: You&rdquo;), you
do not receive a saving throw and power resistance does not apply. The
Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are omitted from such powers.</p>
      <p>Some powers can be manifested only on willing targets.
Declaring yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at
any time (even if you&rsquo;re flat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your
turn). Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing, but
a character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who
is bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not
automatically willing. The Saving Throw and Power Resistance lines are
usually omitted from such powers, since only willing subjects can be
targeted.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> Some powers,
such as most metacreativity powers, create things rather than affect
things that are already present. Unless otherwise noted in the power
description, you must designate the location where these things are to
appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far
away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile, it can move
regardless of the power&rsquo;s range once created.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray:</span> Some effects are
rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you
make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with
a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature
and hope you hit something. You don&rsquo;t have to see the creature
you&rsquo;re trying to hit, as you do with a targeted power.
Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of
sight or provide cover for the creature you&rsquo;re aiming at.</p>
      <p>If a ray power has a duration, it&rsquo;s the duration of the
effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself
persists.</p>
      <p>If a ray power deals damage, you can score a critical hit just
as if it were a weapon. A ray power threatens a critical hit on a
natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread:</span> Some effects
spread out from a point of origin (which may be a grid intersection, or
may be the manifester) to a distance described in the power. The effect
can extend around corners and into areas that you can&rsquo;t see.
Figure distance by actual distance traveled, taking into account turns
the effect may take. When determining distance for spread effects,
count around walls, not through them. As with movement, do not trace
diagonals across corners. You must designate the point of origin for
such an effect (unless the effect is centered on you), but you need not
have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S) Shapeable:</span> If an
Effect line ends with &ldquo;(S)&rdquo; you can shape the power. A
shaped effect can have no dimension smaller than 10 feet.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> Some powers
affect an area. Sometimes a power description specifies a specially
defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories
defined below.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point
where the power originates, but otherwise you usually don&rsquo;t
control which creatures or objects the power affects. The point of
origin of a power that affects an area is always a grid intersection.
When determining whether a given creature is within the area of a
power, count out the distance from the point of origin in squares just
as you do when moving a character or when determining the range for a
ranged attack. The only difference is that instead of counting from the
center of one square to the center of the next, you count from
intersection to intersection.</p>
      <p>You can count diagonally across a square, but every second
diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a square
is within the power&rsquo;s area, anything within that square is within
the power&rsquo;s area. If the power&rsquo;s area touches only the near
edge of a square, however, anything within that square is unaffected by
the power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burst, Emanation, or Spread:</span>
Most powers that affect an area function as a burst, an emanation, or a
spread. In each case, you select the power&rsquo;s point of origin and
measure its effect from that point. A burst power affects whatever it
catches in its area, even including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see.
It can&rsquo;t affect creatures with total cover from its point of
origin (in other words, its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners).
The default shape for a burst effect is a sphere, but some burst powers
are specifically described as cone-shaped.</p>
      <p>A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of origin the power&rsquo;s effect extends.</p>
      <p>An emanation power functions like a burst power, except that
the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the
duration of the power.</p>
      <p>A spread power spreads out like a burst but can turn corners.
You select the point of origin, and the power spreads out a given
distance in all directions. Figure the area the power effect fills by
taking into account any turns the effect takes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Cone, Line, or Sphere: </span>Most
powers that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone,
line, or sphere. A cone-shaped power shoots away from you in a
quarter-circle in the direction you designate. It starts from any
corner of your square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either
bursts or emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around
corners.</p>
      <p>A line-shaped power shoots away from you in a line in the
direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and
extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that
blocks line of effect. A line-shaped power affects all creatures in
squares that the line passes through or touches.</p>
      <p>A sphere-shaped power expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other:</span> A power can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line of Effect:</span> A line
of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a power can
affect. A solid barrier cancels a line of effect, but it is not blocked
by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight. You must
have a clear line of effect to any target that you manifest a power on
or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You must have a
clear line of effect to the point of origin of any power you manifest.</p>
      <p>A burst, cone, or emanation power affects only an area,
creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a
spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s
starting point, or an emanation&rsquo;s point of origin). An otherwise
solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot through it does not
block a power&rsquo;s line of effect. Such an opening means that the
5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no longer considered a
barrier for the purpose of determining a power&rsquo;s line of effect.</p>
