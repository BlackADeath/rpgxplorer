      <p>Magic items are divided into categories: armor, weapons,
potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, and wondrous items. In
addition, some magic items are cursed or intelligent. Finally, a few
magic items are of such rarity and power that they are considered to
belong to a category of their own: artifacts. Artifacts are classified
in turn as minor (extremely rare but not one-of-a-kind items) or major
(each one unique and extremely potent).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor and Shields:</span>
Magic armor (including shields) offers improved, magical protection to
the wearer. Some of these items confer abilities beyond a benefit to
Armor Class.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapons:</span> Magic weapons
are created with a variety of combat powers and almost always improve
the attack and damage rolls of the wielder as well.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Potions:</span> A potion is an elixir concocted with a spell-like effect that affects only the drinker.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rings:</span> A ring is a
circular metal band worn on the finger (no more than two rings per
wearer) that has a spell-like power (often a constant effect that
affects the wearer).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rods:</span> A rod is a scepter-like item with a special power unlike that of any known spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scrolls:</span> A scroll is a spell magically inscribed onto paper or parchment so that it can be used later.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Staffs:</span> A staff has a
number of different (but often related) spell effects. A newly created
staff has 50 charges, and each use of the staff depletes one or more of
those charges.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wands:</span> A wand is a
short stick imbued with the power to cast a specific spell. A newly
created wand has 50 charges, and each use of the wand depletes one of
those charges.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wondrous Items:</span> These objects include magic jewelry, tools, books, clothing, and much more.&nbsp;</p>
