      <p>The known varieties of true dragons (as opposed to other
creatures that have the dragon type) fall into two broad categories:
chromatic and metallic. The chromatic dragons are black, blue, green,
red, and white; they are all evil and extremely fierce. The metallic
dragons are brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver; they are all good,
usually noble, and highly respected by the wise.</p>


      
      
      <p>All true dragons gain more abilities and greater power as they
age. (Other creatures that have the dragon type do not.) They range in
length from several feet upon hatching to more than 100 feet after
attaining the status of great wyrm. The size of a particular dragon
varies according to age and variety.</p>


      
      
      <p>A dragon&rsquo;s metabolism operates like a highly efficient
furnace and can metabolize even inorganic material. Some dragons have
developed a taste for such fare.</p>


      
      
      <p>Although goals and ideals vary among varieties, all dragons
are covetous. They like to hoard wealth, collecting mounds of coins and
gathering as many gems, jewels, and magic items as possible. Those with
large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their
lairs only to patrol the immediate area or to get food. For dragons,
there is no such thing as enough treasure. It&rsquo;s pleasing to look
at, and they bask in its radiance. Dragons like to make beds of their
hoards, shaping nooks and mounds to fit their bodies. By the time a
dragon matures to the age of great wyrm, hundreds of gems and coins may
be imbedded in its hide.</p>


      
      
      <p>All dragons speak Draconic.</p>
