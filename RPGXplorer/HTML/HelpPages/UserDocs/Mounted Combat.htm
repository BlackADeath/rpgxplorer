      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Horses in Combat:</span>
Warhorses and warponies can serve readily as combat steeds. Light
horses, ponies, and heavy horses, however, are frightened by combat. If
you don&rsquo;t dismount, you must make a DC 20 Ride check each round
as a move action to control such a horse. If you succeed, you can
perform a standard action after the move action. If you fail, the move
action becomes a full round action and you can&rsquo;t do anything else
until your next turn.<br>
Your mount acts on your initiative count as you direct it. You move at its speed, but the mount uses its action to move.</p>
      <p>A horse (not a pony) is a Large creature and thus takes up a
space 10 feet (2 squares) across. For simplicity, assume that you share
your mount&rsquo;s space during combat.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat while Mounted: </span>With
a DC 5 Ride check, you can guide your mount with your knees so as to
use both hands to attack or defend yourself. This is a free action.</p>
      <p>When you attack a creature smaller than your mount that is on
foot, you get the +1 bonus on melee attacks for being on higher ground.
If your mount moves more than 5 feet, you can only make a single melee
attack. Essentially, you have to wait until the mount gets to your
enemy before attacking, so you can&rsquo;t make a full attack. Even at
your mount&rsquo;s full speed, you don&rsquo;t take any penalty on
melee attacks while mounted.</p>
      <p>If your mount charges, you also take the AC penalty associated
with a charge. If you make an attack at the end of the charge, you
receive the bonus gained from the charge. When charging on horseback,
you deal double damage with a lance (see Charge).</p>
      <p>You can use ranged weapons while your mount is taking a double
move, but at a &ndash;4 penalty on the attack roll. You can use ranged
weapons while your mount is running (quadruple speed), at a &ndash;8
penalty. In either case, you make the attack roll when your mount has
completed half its movement. You can make a full attack with a ranged
weapon while your mount is moving. Likewise, you can take move actions
normally.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Spells while Mounted:</span>
You can cast a spell normally if your mount moves up to a normal move
(its speed) either before or after you cast. If you have your mount
move both before and after you cast a spell, then you&rsquo;re casting
the spell while the mount is moving, and you have to make a
Concentration check due to the vigorous motion (DC 10 + spell level) or
lose the spell. If the mount is running (quadruple speed), you can cast
a spell when your mount has moved up to twice its speed, but your
Concentration check is more difficult due to the violent motion (DC 15
+ spell level).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If Your Mount Falls in Battle:</span>
If your mount falls, you have to succeed on a DC 15 Ride check to make
a soft fall and take no damage. If the check fails, you take 1d6 points
of damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If You Are Dropped:</span> If
you are knocked unconscious, you have a 50% chance to stay in the
saddle (or 75% if you&rsquo;re in a military saddle). Otherwise you
fall and take 1d6 points of damage.<br>
Without you to guide it, your mount avoids combat.&nbsp;</p>
