      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell-Like Abilities: </span>Usually,
a spell-like ability works just like the spell of that name. A few
spell-like abilities are unique; these are explained in the text where
they are described.</p>

      
      <p>A spell-like ability has no verbal, somatic, or material
component, nor does it require a focus or have an XP cost. The user
activates it mentally. Armor never affects a spell-like ability&rsquo;s
use, even if the ability resembles an arcane spell with a somatic
component.</p>

      
      <p>A spell-like ability has a casting time of 1 standard action
unless noted otherwise in the ability or spell description. In all
other ways, a spell-like ability functions just like a spell.</p>
      <p>
Spell-like abilities are subject to spell resistance and to being dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>.
They do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated.
Spell-like abilities cannot be used to counterspell, nor can they be
counterspelled.</p>

      
      <p>Some creatures are actually sorcerers of a sort. They cast
arcane spells as sorcerers do, using components when required. In fact,
an individual creature could have some spell-like abilities and also
cast other spells as a sorcerer.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supernatural Abilities: </span>These
abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as spells can, and they
generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Supernatural abilities
are not subject to spell resistance, counterspells, or to being
dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel magic</span>, and do not function in areas where magic is suppressed or negated.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extraordinary Abilities:</span>
These abilities cannot be disrupted in combat, as spells can, and they
generally do not provoke attacks of opportunity. Effects or areas that
negate or disrupt magic have no effect on extraordinary abilities. They
are not subject to dispelling, and they function normally in an <span style="font-style: italic;">antimagic field</span>. Indeed, extraordinary abilities do not qualify as magical, though they may break the laws of physics.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Abilities: </span>This
category includes abilities a creature has because of its physical
nature. Natural abilities are those not otherwise designated as
extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like.
