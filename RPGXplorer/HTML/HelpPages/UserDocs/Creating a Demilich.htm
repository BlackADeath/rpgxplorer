      <p>&ldquo;Demilich&rdquo; is a tem-plate that can be added to any
lich. It uses all the lich&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities
except as noted here. A demilich&rsquo;s form is concentrated into a
single portion of its original body, usually its skull. Part of the
process of becoming a demilich includes the incorporation of costly
gems into the retained body part; see Creating Soul Gems, below. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size:</span> Medium-size and
Large liches become Diminutive demiliches, Huge liches become Small
demiliches, Gargantuan liches become Medium-size demiliches, and
Colossal liches become Large demiliches. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice:</span> As lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> Replace with fly 180 ft. (perfect) or the lich&rsquo;s supernatural (not natural) fly speed, whichever is better. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">AC:</span> The demilich
retains the lich&rsquo;s +5 natural armor bonus and gains an insight
bonus equal to AC equal to its Hit Dice, as well as a probable size
adjustment to AC. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack: </span>The demilich gains an insight bonus equal to its Hit Dice as a bonus on its touch attacks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage:</span> The demilich
gains an enhanced touch attack over that of its previous lich form (it
now uses its entire flying skull to make the touch attack), including
paralyzing touch. The demilich&rsquo;s touch attack uses negative
energy to deal 10d6+20 points of damage to living creatures (no saving
throw). Liches with other natural attacks lose them. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks:</span> The demilich retains all the lich&rsquo;s special attacks and also gains those described below. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Trap the Soul (Su):</span>
A demilich can trap the souls of up to eight living creatures per day.
To use this power, it selects any target it can see within 300 feet.
The target is allowed a Fort saving throw (DC 10 + demilich&rsquo;s HD
+ demilich&rsquo;s Cha modifier). If the target makes its saving throw,
it gains four negative levels (this does not count as a use of trap the
soul). If the target fails its save, the soul of the target is
instantly drawn from its body and trapped within one of the gems
incorporated into the demilich&rsquo;s form. The gem gleams wickedly
for 24 hours, indicating the captive soul within. The soulless body
collapses in a mass of corruption and molders in a single round,
reduced to dust. If left to its own devices, the demilich slowly
devours the soul over 24 hours&mdash;at the end of that time the soul
is completely absorbed, and the victim is forever gone. If the demilich
is overcome before the soul is eaten, crushing the gem releases the
soul, after which time it is free to seek the afterlife or be returned
to its body by the use of either resurrection, true resurrection,
clone, or miracle. If the demilich is overcome before the soul is
eaten, crushing the gem releases the soul, after which time it is free
to seek the afterlife or be returned to its body by the use of either
resurrection, true resurrection, clone, or miracle. A potential victim
protected by a death ward spell is not immune to trap the soul, but
receives a +5 bonus on its Fortitude saving throw and is effective
against the level loss on a successful save. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Fear Aura (Su):</span>
Demiliches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures
of less than 5 HD in a 60- foot radius that look at the demilich must
succeed at a Will save (DC 14 + demilich&rsquo;s Cha modifier) or be
affected as though by fear as cast by a 21st-level caster. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Paralyzing Touch (Su): </span>Any
living creature a demilich touches must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC
10 + demilich&rsquo;s HD + demilich&rsquo;s Cha modifier) or be
permanently paralyzed. Remove paralysis or any spell that can remove a
curse can free the victim. The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone
paralyzed by a demilich seems dead, though a successful Spot check (DC
20) or Heal check (DC 15) reveals that the victim is still alive. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spells:</span> The demilich can cast any spells it could cast as a lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Perfect Automatic Still Spell: </span>The demilich can cast all the spells it knows without gestures. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell-Like Abilities:</span> At will - <span style="font-style: italic;">alter self, astral projection, create greater undead, create undead, death knell, enervation, greater dispel magic, harm</span> (usually used to heal itself ), <span style="font-style: italic;">summon monster I&ndash;IX, telekinesis,</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">weird;</span> 2/day -<span style="font-style: italic;"> greater planar ally.</span>
Demiliches use these abilities as casters of a level equal to their
spellcaster level, but the save DCs are equal to 10 + the
demilich&rsquo;s HD + the demilich&rsquo;s Charisma modifier. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities:</span> The demilich retains all the lich&rsquo;s special qualities and also has those described below. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Magic Immunity (Ex):</span>
Demiliches are immune to all magical and supernatural effects, except
as follows. A shatter spell affects a demilich as if it were a
crystalline creature, but deals half the damage normally indicated. A
dispel evil spell deals 3d6 points of damage (Fort save for half
damage). Holy smite spells affect demiliches normally. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Phylactery Transference (Su):</span>
Headbands, belts, rings, cloaks, and other wearable items kept in close
association with the demilich&rsquo;s phylactery transfer all their
benefits to the demilich no matter how far apart the demilich and the
phylactery are located. The standard limits on types of items utilized
simultaneously still apply. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Undead Traits:</span>
Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, death, effects,
necromantic effects, mind-affecting effects, and any effect requiring a
Fortitude save unless it also works on objects. Not subject to critical
hits, subdual damage, ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain.
Negative energy heals. Not at risk of death from massive damage, but
destroyed at 0 hit points or less. Darkvision 60 ft. Cannot be raised;
resurrection works only if creature is willing. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Immunities (Ex):</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Demiliches are immune to cold, electricity, polymorph, and mind-affecting attacks. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Turn Resistance (Ex):</span> A demilich has turn resistance +20. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Damage Reduction (Su):</span>
A demilich loses any previous damage reduction and instead has damage
reduction 15/Epic and bludgeoning (15&nbsp; points of damage is
subtracted from all melee attacks unless the weapon used is both an
epic and a bludgeoning weapon). Vorpal weapons, no matter their
enhancement bonus, ignore this damage reduction but do only half damage
to a demilich (demiliches cannot be beheaded). </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Resistances (Ex):</span> Demiliches have acid resistance 20, fire resistance 20, and sonic resistance 20. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saves:</span> Same as the lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities:</span> A demilich gains +10 to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills:</span> Demiliches
receive a +20 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search,
Sense Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the lich (this
overlaps with the previous racial bonus gained by the lich; it does not
stack). </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats:</span> Same as the lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Epic Feats:</span> Demiliches gain the feats Blinding Speed, Tenacious Magic, and Automatic Quicken Spell. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Climate/Terrain:</span> Same as the lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span> Solitary or consistory (1 demilich and 3&ndash;6 liches). </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating: </span>Same as the lich + 6. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure: </span>Same as the lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> Any evil. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advancement:</span> By character class. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Demilich&nbsp;Characters:</span>
The process of becoming a demilich can be undertaken only by a lich
acting of its own free will. The demilich retains all class abilities
it had as a lich. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating Soul Gems: </span>Liches
have phylacteries that allow them to reappear 1d10 days after their
apparent death, as do demiliches. Demiliches also have eight soul gems,
each of which acts like a phylactery in its own right. If all the soul
gems, as well as the demilich&rsquo;s phylactery, are not destroyed
after a demilich is downed, the demilich reappears 1d10 days after its
apparent death. The soul gems also allow the demilich to use its most
devastating ability, trap the soul (see above). Each demilich must make
its own soul gems, which requires the Craft Wondrous Item feat. The
lich must be a sorcerer, wizard, or cleric of at least 21st level. Each
soul gem costs 120,000 gp and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level
equal to that of its creator at the time of creation. Soul gems appear
as egg-shaped gems of wondrous quality. They are always incorporated
directly into the concentrated form of the demilich. </p>
