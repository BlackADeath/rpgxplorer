      <p>&nbsp;An incorporeal creature has no physical body. It can be
harmed only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures
that strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or
supernatural abilities. It is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, it has a 50% chance to ignore
any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,
negative energy, force effects such as <span style="font-style: italic;">magic missile</span>, or attacks made with <span style="font-style: italic;">ghost touch</span>
weapons). Although it is not a magical attack, holy water can affect
incorporeal undead, but a hit with holy water has a 50% chance of not
affecting an incorporeal creature.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature has no natural armor bonus but has a
deflection bonus equal to its Charisma bonus (always at least +1, even
if the creature&rsquo;s Charisma score does not normally provide a
bonus).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature can enter or pass through solid
objects, but must remain adjacent to the object&rsquo;s exterior, and
so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger than
its own. It can sense the presence of creatures or objects within a
square adjacent to its current location, but enemies have total
concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal creature that is
inside an object. In order to see farther from the object it is in and
attack normally, the incorporeal creature must emerge. An incorporeal
creature inside an object has total cover, but when it attacks a
creature outside the object it only has cover, so a creature outside
with a readied action could strike at it as it attacks. An incorporeal
creature cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature&rsquo;s attacks pass through (ignore)
natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses and
force effects (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">mage armor</span>)
work normally against it. Incorporeal creatures pass through and
operate in water as easily as they do in air. Incorporeal creatures
cannot fall or take falling damage. Incorporeal creatures cannot make
trip or grapple attacks, nor can they be tripped or grappled. In fact,
they cannot take any physical action that would move or manipulate an
opponent or its equipment, nor are they subject to such actions.
Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps that are
triggered by weight.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal creature moves silently and cannot be heard
with Listen checks if it doesn&rsquo;t wish to be. It has no Strength
score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its melee attacks and
its ranged attacks. Nonvisual senses, such as scent and blindsight, are
either ineffective or only partly effective with regard to incorporeal
creatures. Incorporeal creatures have an innate sense of direction and
can move at full speed even when they cannot see.
