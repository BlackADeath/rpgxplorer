      <p>Doors in dungeons are much more than mere entrances and exits. Often they can be encounters all by themselves.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>Dungeon doors come in three basic types: wooden, stone, and iron.</p>

      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Doors:</span> Constructed
of thick planks nailed together, sometimes bound with iron for strength
(and to reduce swelling from dungeon dampness), wooden doors are the
most common type. Wooden doors come in varying strengths: simple, good,
and strong doors. Simple doors (break DC 13) are not meant to keep out
motivated attackers. Good doors (break DC 16), while sturdy and
long-lasting, are still not meant to take much punishment. Strong doors
(break DC 23) are bound in iron and are a sturdy barrier to those
attempting to get past them. Iron hinges fasten the door to its frame,
and typically a circular pull-ring in the center is there to help open
it. Sometimes, instead of a pull-ring, a door has an iron pull-bar on
one or both sides of the door to serve as a handle. In inhabited
dungeons, these doors are usually well maintained (not stuck) and
unlocked, although important areas are locked up if possible.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stone:</span> Carved from solid
blocks of stone, these heavy, unwieldy doors are often built so that
they pivot when opened, although dwarves and other skilled craftsfolk
are able to fashion hinges strong enough to hold up a stone door.
Secret doors concealed within a stone wall are usually stone doors.
Otherwise, such doors stand as tough barriers protecting something
important beyond. Thus, they are often locked or barred.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron:</span> Rusted but sturdy,
iron doors in a dungeon are hinged like wooden doors. These doors are
the toughest form of nonmagical door. They are usually locked or barred.<br>

Locks, Bars, and Seals: Dungeon doors may be locked, trapped,
reinforced, barred, magically sealed, or sometimes just stuck. All but
the weakest characters can eventually knock down a door with a heavy
tool such as a sledgehammer, and a number of spells and magic items
give characters an easy way around a locked door.<br>

      <br>

Attempts to literally chop a door down with a slashing or bludgeoning
weapon use the hardness and hit points given in Table: Doors. Often the
easiest way to overcome a recalcitrant door is not by demolishing it
but by breaking its lock, bar, or hinges. When assigning a DC to an
attempt to knock a door down, use the following as guidelines:<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">DC 10 or Lower:</span> a door just about anyone can break open.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">DC 11-15: </span>a door that a strong person could break with one try and an average person might be able to break with one try. <br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">DC 16-20:</span> a door that almost anyone could break, given time.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">DC 21-25:</span> a door that only a strong or very strong person has a hope of breaking, probably not on the first try.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">DC 26 or Higher:</span> a door that only an exceptionally strong person has a hope of breaking.<br>

      <br>

For specific examples in applying these guidelines, see Table: Random Door Types. <br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Locks:</span> Dungeon doors are
often locked, and thus the Open Lock skill comes in very handy. Locks
are usually built into the door, either on the edge opposite the hinges
or right in the middle of the door. Builtin locks either control an
iron bar that juts out of the door and into the wall of its frame, or
else a sliding iron bar or heavy wooden bar that rests behind the
entire door. By contrast, padlocks are not built-in but usually run
through two rings, one on the door and the other on the wall. More
complex locks, such as combination locks and puzzle locks, are usually
built into the door itself. Because such keyless locks are larger and
more complex, they are typically only found in sturdy doors (strong
wooden, stone, or iron doors).<br>

      <br>

The Open Lock DC to pick a lock often falls into the range of 20 to 30,
although locks with lower or higher DCs can exist. A door can have more
than one lock, each of which must be unlocked separately. Locks are
often trapped, usually with poison needles that extend out to prick a
rogue&rsquo;s finger.<br>

      <br>

Breaking a lock is sometimes quicker than breaking the whole door. If a
PC wants to whack at a lock with a weapon, treat the typical lock as
having hardness 15 and 30 hit points. A lock can only be broken if it
can be attacked separately from the door, which means that a built-in
lock is immune to this sort of treatment. In an occupied dungeon, every
locked door should have a key somewhere. <br>

      <br>

A special door (see below for examples) might have a lock with no key,
instead requiring that the right combination of nearby levers must be
manipulated or the right symbols must be pressed on a keypad in the
correct sequence to open the door.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stuck Doors:</span> Dungeons are
often damp, and sometimes doors get stuck, particularly wooden doors.
Assume that about 10% of wooden doors and 5% of nonwooden doors are
stuck. These numbers can be doubled (to 20% and 10%, respectively) for
long-abandoned or neglected dungeons.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Barred Doors:</span> When
characters try to bash down a barred door, it&rsquo;s the quality of
the bar that matters, not the material the door is made of. It takes a
DC 25 Strength check to break through a door with a wooden bar, and a
DC 30 Strength check if the bar is made of iron. Characters can attack
the door and destroy it instead, leaving the bar hanging in the
now-open doorway.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Seals:</span> In addition
to magic traps spells such as arcane lock can discourage passage
through a door. A door with an arcane lock spell on it is considered
locked even if it doesn&rsquo;t have a physical lock. It takes a knock
spell, a dispel magic spell, or a successful Strength check&nbsp; to
get through such a door.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hinges:</span> Most doors have
hinges. Obviously, sliding doors do not. (They usually have tracks or
grooves instead, allowing them to slide easily to one side.)<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Standard Hinges:</span> These
hinges are metal, joining one edge of the door to the doorframe or
wall. Remember that the door swings open toward the side with the
hinges. (So, if the hinges are on the PCs&rsquo; side, the door opens
toward them; otherwise it opens away from them.) Adventurers can take
the hinges apart one at a time with successful Disable Device checks
(assuming the hinges are on their side of the door, of course). Such a
task has a DC of 20 because most hinges are rusted or stuck. Breaking a
hinge is difficult. Most have hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The break
DC for a hinge is the same as for breaking down the door.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Nested Hinges:</span> These
hinges are much more complex than ordinary hinges, and are found only
in areas of excellent construction. These hinges are built into the
wall and allow the door to swing open in either direction. PCs
can&rsquo;t get at the hinges to fool with them unless they break
through the doorframe or wall. Nested hinges are typically found on
stone doors but sometimes on wooden or iron doors as well. <br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pivots:</span> Pivots
aren&rsquo;t really hinges at all, but simple knobs jutting from the
top and bottom of the door that fit into holes in the doorframe,
allowing the door to spin. The advantages of pivots is that they
can&rsquo;t be dismantled like hinges and they&rsquo;re simple to make.
The disadvantage is that since the door pivots on its center of gravity
(typically in the middle), nothing larger than half the door&rsquo;s
width can fit through. Doors with pivots are usually stone and are
often quite wide to overcome this disadvantage. Another solution is to
place the pivot toward one side and have the door be thicker at that
end and thinner toward the other end so that it opens more like a
normal door. Secret doors in walls often turn on pivots, since the lack
of hinges makes it easier to hide the door&rsquo;s presence. Pivots
also allow objects such as bookcases to be used as secret doors.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secret Doors:</span> Disguised
as a bare patch of wall (or floor, or ceiling), a bookcase, a
fireplace, or a fountain, a secret door leads to a secret passage or
room. Someone examining the area finds a secret door, if one exists, on
a successful Search check (DC 20 for a typical secret door to DC 30 for
a well-hidden secret door). Elves have a chance to detect a secret door
just by casually looking at an area.<br>

      <br>

Many secret doors require a special method of opening, such as a hidden
button or pressure plate. Secret doors can open like normal doors, or
they may pivot, slide, sink, rise, or even lower like a drawbridge to
permit access. Builders might put a secret door down low near the floor
or high up in a wall, making it difficult to find or reach. Wizards and
sorcerers have a spell, phase door, that allows them to create a magic
secret door that only they can use.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Doors:</span> Enchanted by
the original builders, a door might speak to explorers, warning them
away. It might be protected from harm, increasing its hardness or
giving it more hit points as well as an improved saving throw bonus
against disintegrate and other similar spells. A magic door might not
lead into the space revealed beyond, but instead it might be a portal
to a faraway place or even another plane of existence. Other magic
doors might require passwords or special keys to open them. <br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Portcullises:</span> These
special doors consist of iron or thick, ironbound, wooden shafts that
descend from a recess in the ceiling above an archway. Sometimes a
portcullis has crossbars that create a grid, sometimes not. Typically
raised by means of a winch or a capstan, a portcullis can be dropped
quickly, and the shafts end in spikes to discourage anyone from
standing underneath (or from attempting to dive under it as it drops).
Once it is dropped, a portcullis locks, unless it is so large that no
normal person could lift it anyway. In any event, lifting a typical
portcullis requires a DC 25 Strength check.<br>
