      <p>Typical city streets are narrow and twisting. Most streets
average 15 to 20 feet wide [(1d4+1)&times;5 feet)], while alleys range
from 10 feet wide to only 5 feet. Cobblestones in good condition allow
normal movement, but ones in poor repair and heavily rutted dirt
streets are considered light rubble, increasing the DC of Balance and
Tumble checks by 2.<br>
Some cities have no larger thoroughfares, particularly cities that
gradually grew from small settlements to larger cities. Cities that are
planned, or perhaps have suffered a major fire that allowed authorities
to construct new roads through formerly inhabited areas, might have a
few larger streets through town. These main roads are 25 feet
wide-offering room for wagons to pass each other-with 5-foot-wide
sidewalks on either side.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crowds:</span> Urban streets
are often full of people going about their daily lives. In most cases,
it isn&rsquo;t necessary to put every 1st-level commoner on the map
when a fight breaks out on the city&rsquo;s main thoroughfare. Instead
just indicate which squares on the map contain crowds. If crowds see
something obviously dangerous, they&rsquo;ll move away at 30 feet per
round at initiative count 0. It takes 2 squares of movement to enter a
square with crowds. The crowds provide cover for anyone who does so,
enabling a Hide check and providing a bonus to Armor Class and on
Reflex saves.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Directing Crowds:</span> It
takes a DC 15 Diplomacy check or DC 20 Intimidate check to convince a
crowd to move in a particular direction, and the crowd must be able to
hear or see the character making the attempt. It takes a full-round
action to make the Diplomacy check, but only a free action to make the
Intimidate check.</p>
      <p>If two or more characters are trying to direct a crowd in
different directions, they make opposed Diplomacy or Intimidate checks
to determine whom the crowd listens to. The crowd ignores everyone if
none of the characters&rsquo; check results beat the DCs given above.
