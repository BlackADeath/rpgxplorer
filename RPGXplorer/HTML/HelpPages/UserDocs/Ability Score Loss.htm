					<P>Various attacks cause ability score loss, either ability damage or ability
					  drain. Points lost to ability damage return at the rate of 1 point per
					  day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged
					  ability, and the spells lesser restoration and restoration offset ability
					  damage as well. Ability drain, however, is permanent, though restoration
				  can restore even those lost ability score points.</P>
					<P>While any loss is debilitating, losing all points in an
				    ability score can be devastating.</P>					
					<ul>
					  <li>Strength 0 means that the character cannot move at all.
			        He lies helpless on the ground.</li>
					  <li> Dexterity 0 means that the character
			        cannot move at all. He stands motionless, rigid, and helpless.</li>
					  <li> Constitution 0 means that the character is dead.</li>
					  <li> Intelligence 0 means that the character cannot think and
	                  is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless. </li>
					  <li> Wisdom 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep
	                  sleep filled with nightmares, helpless.</li>
					  <li> Charisma 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a
                    catatonic, coma-like stupor, helpless. </li>
				  </ul>					<P>Keeping track of negative ability score points
					                  is never necessary. A character&#8217;s ability score
					                  can&#8217;t
                  drop below 0.Having a score of 0 in an ability is different
                  from having no ability score whatsoever.</P>
					<P>Some spells or abilities impose an effective
					                  ability score reduction, which is different
					                  from ability score loss. Any such reduction
					                  disappears at the end of the spell&#8217;s or ability&#8217;s
					                  duration, and the ability score immediately
                  returns to its former value.</P>
					<P>If a character&#8217;s Constitution score drops, then he loses 1 hit
					  point per Hit Die for every point by which his Constitution modifier drops.
					                  A hit point score can&#8217;t be reduced by Constitution
					                  damage or drain to less than 1 hit point
                  per Hit Die.</P>
					<P>The ability that some creatures have to
					                    drain ability scores is a supernatural
					                    one, requiring some sort of attack. Such
					                    creatures do not drain abilities from
					      enemies when the enemies strike them, even with unarmed
					                    attacks or natural weapons<br>
