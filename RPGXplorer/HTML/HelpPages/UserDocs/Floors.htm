      <p>As with walls, dungeon floors come in many types.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flagstone:</span> Like
masonry walls, flagstone floors are made of fitted stones. They are
usually cracked and only somewhat level. Slime and mold grows in these
cracks. Sometimes water runs in rivulets between the stones or sits in
stagnant puddles. Flagstone is the most common dungeon floor.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uneven Flagstone:</span> Over
time, some floors can become so uneven that a DC 10 Balance check is
required to run or charge across the surface. Failure means the
character can&rsquo;t move in this round. Floors as treacherous as this
should be the exception, not the rule.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hewn Stone Floors:</span>
Rough and uneven, hewn floors are usually covered with loose stones,
gravel, dirt, or other debris. A DC 10 Balance check is required to run
or charge across such a floor. Failure means the character can still
act, but can&rsquo;t run or charge in this round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Rubble:</span> Small chunks of debris litter the ground. Light rubble adds 2 to the DC of Balance and Tumble checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dense Rubble:</span> The
ground is covered with debris of all sizes. It costs 2 squares of
movement to enter a square with dense rubble. Dense rubble adds 5 to
the DC of Balance and Tumble checks, and it adds 2 to the DC of Move
Silently checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smooth Stone Floors:</span> Finished and sometimes even polished, smooth floors are found only in dungeons with capable and careful builders.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Stone Floors:</span>
The floor of a natural cave is as uneven as the walls. Caves rarely
have flat surfaces of any great size. Rather, their floors have many
levels. Some adjacent floor surfaces might vary in elevation by only a
foot, so that moving from one to the other is no more difficult than
negotiating a stair step, but in other places the floor might suddenly
drop off or rise up several feet or more, requiring Climb checks to get
from one surface to the other. Unless a path has been worn and well
marked in the floor of a natural cave, it takes 2 squares of movement
to enter a square with a natural stone floor, and the DC of Balance and
Tumble checks increases by 5. Running and charging are impossible,
except along paths.
