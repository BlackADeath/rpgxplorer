      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grapple Checks</span><br>
Repeatedly in a grapple, you need to make opposed grapple checks
against an opponent. A grapple check is like a melee attack roll. Your
attack bonus on a grapple check is: Base attack bonus + Strength
modifier + special size modifier.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Size Modifier:</span>
The special size modifier for a grapple check is as follows: Colossal
+16, Gargantuan +12, Huge +8, Large +4, Medium +0, Small &ndash;4, Tiny
&ndash;8, Diminutive &ndash;12, Fine &ndash;16. Use this number in
place of the normal size modifier you use when making an attack roll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Starting a Grapple</span><br>
To start a grapple, you need to grab and hold your target. Starting a
grapple requires a successful melee attack roll. If you get multiple
attacks, you can attempt to start a grapple multiple times (at
successively lower base attack bonuses).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1:</span> Attack of
Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you
are trying to grapple. If the attack of opportunity deals damage, the
grapple attempt fails. (Certain monsters do not provoke attacks of
opportunity when they attempt to grapple, nor do characters with the
Improved Grapple feat.) If the attack of opportunity misses or fails to
deal damage, proceed to Step 2.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2:</span> Grab. You make
a melee touch attack to grab the target. If you fail to hit the target,
the grapple attempt fails. If you succeed, proceed to Step 3.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 3:</span> Hold. Make an opposed grapple check as a free action.</p>
      <p>If you succeed, you and your target are now grappling, and you deal damage to the target as if with an unarmed strike.</p>
      <p>If you lose, you fail to start the grapple. You automatically
lose an attempt to hold if the target is two or more size categories
larger than you are.</p>
      <p>In case of a tie, the combatant with the higher grapple check modifier wins. If this is a tie, roll again to break the tie.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 4:</span> Maintain
Grapple. To maintain the grapple for later rounds, you must move into
the target&rsquo;s space. (This movement is free and doesn&rsquo;t
count as part of your movement in the round.)</p>
      <p>Moving, as normal, provokes attacks of opportunity from threatening opponents, but not from your target.</p>
      <p>If you can&rsquo;t move into your target&rsquo;s space, you
can&rsquo;t maintain the grapple and must immediately let go of the
target. To grapple again, you must begin at Step 1.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Grappling Consequences</span><br>
While you&rsquo;re grappling, your ability to attack others and defend yourself is limited.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Threatened Squares:</span> You don&rsquo;t threaten any squares while grappling.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Dexterity Bonus:</span>
You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if you have one) against opponents
you aren&rsquo;t grappling. (You can still use it against opponents you
are grappling.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No Movement:</span> You
can&rsquo;t move normally while grappling. You may, however, make an
opposed grapple check (see below) to move while grappling.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If You&rsquo;re Grappling</span><br>
When you are grappling (regardless of who started the grapple), you can
perform any of the following actions. Some of these actions take the
place of an attack (rather than being a standard action or a move
action). If your base attack bonus allows you multiple attacks, you can
attempt one of these actions in place of each of your attacks, but at
successively lower base attack bonuses.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate a Magic Item:</span>
You can activate a magic item, as long as the item doesn&rsquo;t
require a spell completion trigger. You don&rsquo;t need to make a
grapple check to activate the item.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack Your Opponent:</span>
You can make an attack with an unarmed strike, natural weapon, or light
weapon against another character you are grappling. You take a &ndash;4
penalty on such attacks.</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t attack with two weapons while grappling, even if both are light weapons.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cast a Spell:</span> You can
attempt to cast a spell while grappling or even while pinned (see
below), provided its casting time is no more than 1 standard action, it
has no somatic component, and you have in hand any material components
or focuses you might need. Any spell that requires precise and careful
action is impossible to cast while grappling or being pinned. If the
spell is one that you can cast while grappling, you must make a
Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level) or lose the spell. You
don&rsquo;t have to make a successful grapple check to cast the spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage Your Opponent: </span>While
grappling, you can deal damage to your opponent equivalent to an
unarmed strike. Make an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If
you win, you deal nonlethal damage as normal for your unarmed strike
(1d3 points for Medium attackers or 1d2 points for Small attackers,
plus Strength modifiers). If you want to deal lethal damage, you take a
&ndash;4 penalty on your grapple check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span> Monks deal
more damage on an unarmed strike than other characters, and the damage
is lethal. However, they can choose to deal their damage as nonlethal
damage when grappling without taking the usual &ndash;4 penalty for
changing lethal damage to nonlethal damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Draw a Light Weapon:</span> You can draw a light weapon as a move action with a successful grapple check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Escape from Grapple:</span>
You can escape a grapple by winning an opposed grapple check in place
of making an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of
your grapple check if you so desire, but this requires a standard
action. If more than one opponent is grappling you, your grapple check
result has to beat all their individual check results to escape.
(Opponents don&rsquo;t have to try to hold you if they don&rsquo;t want
to.) If you escape, you finish the action by moving into any space
adjacent to your opponent(s).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Move:</span> You can move
half your speed (bringing all others engaged in the grapple with you)
by winning an opposed grapple check. This requires a standard action,
and you must beat all the other individual check results to move the
grapple.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> You get a +4 bonus on your grapple check to move a pinned opponent, but only if no one else is involved in the grapple.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Retrieve a Spell Component:</span>
You can produce a spell component from your pouch while grappling by
using a full-round action. Doing so does not require a successful
grapple check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pin Your Opponent:</span> You
can hold your opponent immobile for 1 round by winning an opposed
grapple check (made in place of an attack). Once you have an opponent
pinned, you have a few options available to you (see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Break Another&rsquo;s Pin:</span>
If you are grappling an opponent who has another character pinned, you
can make an opposed grapple check in place of an attack. If you win,
you break the hold that the opponent has over the other character. The
character is still grappling, but is no longer pinned.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Opponent&rsquo;s Weapon:</span>
If your opponent is holding a light weapon, you can use it to attack
him. Make an opposed grapple check (in place of an attack). If you win,
make an attack roll with the weapon with a &ndash;4 penalty (doing this
doesn&rsquo;t require another action).</p>
      <p>You don&rsquo;t gain possession of the weapon by performing this action.</p>
      <p><br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If You&rsquo;re Pinning an Opponent</span><br>
You can attempt to damage your opponent with an opposed grapple check,
you can attempt to use your opponent&rsquo;s weapon against him, or you
can attempt to move the grapple (all described above). At your option,
you can prevent a pinned opponent from speaking.</p>
      <p>You can use a disarm action to remove or grab away a well
secured object worn by a pinned opponent, but he gets a +4 bonus on his
roll to resist your attempt (see Disarm).</p>
      <p>You may voluntarily release a pinned character as a free
action; if you do so, you are no longer considered to be grappling that
character (and vice versa).</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t draw or use a weapon (against the pinned
character or any other character), escape another&rsquo;s grapple,
retrieve a spell component, pin another character, or break
another&rsquo;s pin while you are pinning an opponent.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If You&rsquo;re Pinned by an Opponent</span><br>
When an opponent has pinned you, you are held immobile (but not
helpless) for 1 round. While you&rsquo;re pinned, you take a &ndash;4
penalty to your AC against opponents other than the one pinning you. At
your opponent&rsquo;s option, you may also be unable to speak. On your
turn, you can try to escape the pin by making an opposed grapple check
in place of an attack. You can make an Escape Artist check in place of
your grapple check if you want, but this requires a standard action. If
you win, you escape the pin, but you&rsquo;re still grappling.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Joining a Grapple</span><br>
If your target is already grappling someone else, you can use an attack
to start a grapple, as above, except that the target doesn&rsquo;t get
an attack of opportunity against you, and your grab automatically
succeeds. You still have to make a successful opposed grapple check to
become part of the grapple.</p>
      <p>If there are multiple opponents involved in the grapple, you pick one to make the opposed grapple check against.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Grapplers</span><br>
Several combatants can be in a single grapple. Up to four combatants
can grapple a single opponent in a given round. Creatures that are one
or more size categories smaller than you count for half, creatures that
are one size category larger than you count double, and creatures two
or more size categories larger count quadruple.</p>
      <p>When you are grappling with multiple opponents, you choose one
opponent to make an opposed check against. The exception is an attempt
to escape from the grapple; to successfully escape, your grapple check
must beat the check results of each opponent.</p>
