      <p>If you buy
a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on
checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes'
skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.<br>




      <br>




Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.<br>




      <br>




Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do
not round up or down).<br>




      <br>




      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Skills:</span>
To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier =
skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)<br>




      <br>




This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw- the higher
the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain
Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's
check result.<br>




      <br>




      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill Ranks:</span>
A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill
points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used
even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making
an untrained skill check.<br>




      <br>




      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Modifier:</span>
The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the
skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The
key ability of each skill is noted in its description.<br>




      <br>




      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous
Modifiers:</span> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses,
armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.<br>




      <br>




Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that
skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class
skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your
character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not
found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve
your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill
points to spend later.<br>




      <br>




The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's
a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not
round up or down).<br>




      <br>




Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a
cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your
maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.
