      <p>Darkvision allows many characters and monsters to see
perfectly well without any light at all, but characters with normal
vision (or low-light vision, for that matter) can be rendered
completely blind by putting out the lights. Torches or lanterns can be
blown out by sudden gusts of subterranean wind, magical light sources
can be dispelled or countered, or magical traps might create fields of
impenetrable darkness.</p>


      
      
      <p>In many cases, some characters or monsters might be able to
see, while others are blinded. For purposes of the following points, a
blinded creature is one who simply can&rsquo;t see through the
surrounding darkness.</p>


      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>


        <li>Creatures blinded by darkness lose the ability to deal extra damage due to precision (for example, a sneak attack).</li>

        <li>Blinded creatures are hampered in their movement, and pay 2
squares of movement per square moved into (double normal cost). Blinded
creatures can&rsquo;t run or charge.</li>

        <li>All opponents have total concealment from a blinded
creature, so the blinded creature has a 50% miss chance in combat. A
blinded creature must first pinpoint the location of an opponent in
order to attack the right square; if the blinded creature launches an
attack without pinpointing its foe, it attacks a random square within
its reach. For ranged attacks or spells against a foe whose location is
not pinpointed, roll to determine which adjacent square the blinded
creature is facing; its attack is directed at the closest target that
lies in that direction.</li>

        <li>A blinded creature loses its Dexterity adjustment to AC and takes a -2 penalty to AC.</li>

        <li>A blinded creature takes a -4 penalty on Search checks and
most Strength- and Dexterity-based skill checks, including any with an
armor check penalty. A creature blinded by darkness automatically fails
any skill check relying on vision.</li>

        <li>Creatures blinded by darkness cannot use gaze attacks and are immune to gaze attacks.
A creature blinded by darkness can make a Listen check as a free action
each round in order to locate foes (DC equal to opponents&rsquo; Move
Silently checks). A successful check lets a blinded character hear an
unseen creature &ldquo;over there somewhere.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s almost
impossible to pinpoint the location of an unseen creature. A Listen
check that beats the DC by 20 reveals the unseen creature&rsquo;s
square (but the unseen creature still has total concealment from the
blinded creature).<br>


        </li>

        <li>A blinded creature can grope about to find unseen
creatures. A character can make a touch attack with his hands or a
weapon into two adjacent squares using a standard action. If an unseen
target is in the designated square, there is a 50% miss chance on the
touch attack. If successful, the groping character deals no damage but
has pinpointed the unseen creature&rsquo;s current location. (If the
unseen creature moves, its location is once again unknown.)</li>

        <li>If a blinded creature is struck by an unseen foe, the
blinded character pinpoints the location of the creature that struck
him (until the unseen creature moves, of course). The only exception is
if the unseen creature has a reach greater than 5 feet (in which case
the blinded character knows the location of the unseen opponent, but
has not pinpointed him) or uses a ranged attack (in which case, the
blinded character knows the general direction of the foe, but not his
location).</li>

        <li>A creature with the scent ability automatically pinpoints unseen creatures within 5 feet of its location.</li>
