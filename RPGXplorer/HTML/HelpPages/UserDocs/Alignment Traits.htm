      <p>Some planes have a predisposition to a certain alignment. Most
of the inhabitants of these planes also have the plane&rsquo;s
particular alignment, even powerful creatures such as deities. In
addition, creatures of alignments contrary to the plane have a tougher
time dealing with its natives and situations.</p>
      <p>The alignment trait of a plane affects social interactions
there. Characters who follow other alignments than most of the
inhabitants do may find life more difficult.</p>
      <p>Alignment traits have multiple components. First are the moral
(good or evil) and ethical (lawful or chaotic) components; a plane can
have either a moral component, an ethical component, or one of each.
Second, the specific alignment trait indicates whether each moral or
ethical component is mildly or strongly evident.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Good-Aligned/Evil-Aligned: </span>These planes have chosen a side in the battle of good versus evil. No plane can be both good-aligned and evil-aligned.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Law-Aligned/Chaos-Aligned: </span>Law versus chaos is the key struggle for these planes and their residents. No plane can be both law-aligned and chaos-aligned.<br>
      <br>
Each part of the moral/ethical alignment trait has a descriptor, either
&ldquo;mildly&rdquo; or &ldquo;strongly,&rdquo; to show how powerful
the influence of alignment is on the plane.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Mildly Aligned:</span>
Creatures who have an alignment opposite that of a mildly aligned plane
take a -2 circumstance penalty on all Charisma-based checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Strongly Aligned:</span> On
planes that are strongly aligned, a -2 circumstance penalty applies on
all Charisma-based checks made by all creatures not of the
plane&rsquo;s alignment. In addition, the -2 penalty affects all
Intelligence-based and Wisdom-based checks, too.</p>
      <p>The penalties for the moral and ethical components of the alignment trait do stack.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Neutral-Aligned:</span> A mildly neutral-aligned plane does not apply a circumstance penalty to anyone.</p>
      <p>The Material Plane is considered mildly neutral-aligned,
though it may contain high concentrations of evil or good, law or chaos
in places.</p>
      <p>A strongly neutral-aligned plane would stand in opposition to
all other moral and ethical principles: good, evil, law, and chaos.
Such a plane may be more concerned with the balance of the alignments
than with accommodating and accepting alternate points of view. In the
same fashion as for other strongly aligned planes, strongly
neutral-aligned planes apply a -2 circumstance penalty to
Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based checks by any creature that
isn&rsquo;t neutral. The penalty is applied twice (once for law/chaos,
and once for good/evil), so neutral good, neutral evil, lawful neutral,
and chaotic neutral creatures take a -2 penalty and lawful good,
chaotic good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil creatures take a -4 penalty.
