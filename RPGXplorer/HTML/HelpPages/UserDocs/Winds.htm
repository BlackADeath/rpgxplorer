      <p>The wind can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a
large fire, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors away. If
powerful enough, it can even knock characters down (see Table: Wind
Effects), interfere with ranged attacks, or impose penalties on some
skill checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Light Wind:</span> A gentle breeze, having little or no game effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Moderate Wind:</span> A steady wind with a 50% chance of extinguishing small, unprotected flames, such as candles.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Strong Wind: </span>Gusts
that automatically extinguish unprotected flames (candles, torches, and
the like). Such gusts impose a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls and on
Listen checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Severe Wind:</span> In
addition to automatically extinguishing any unprotected flames, winds
of this magnitude cause protected flames (such as those of lanterns) to
dance wildly and have a 50% chance of extinguishing these lights.
Ranged weapon attacks and Listen checks are at a -4 penalty. This is
the velocity of wind produced by a gust of wind spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Windstorm:</span> Powerful
enough to bring down branches if not whole trees, windstorms
automatically extinguish unprotected flames and have a 75% chance of
blowing out protected flames, such as those of lanterns. Ranged weapon
attacks are impossible, and even siege weapons have a -4 penalty on
attack rolls. Listen checks are at a -8 penalty due to the howling of
the wind.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Hurricane-Force Wind:</span>
All flames are extinguished. Ranged attacks are impossible (except with
siege weapons, which have a -8 penalty on attack rolls). Listen checks
are impossible: All characters can hear is the roaring of the wind.
Hurricane-force winds often fell trees.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Tornado (CR 10):</span> All
flames are extinguished. All ranged attacks are impossible (even with
siege weapons), as are Listen checks. Instead of being blown away (see
Table: Wind Effects), characters in close proximity to a tornado who
fail their Fortitude saves are sucked toward the tornado. Those who
come in contact with the actual funnel cloud are picked up and whirled
around for 1d10 rounds, taking 6d6 points of damage per round, before
being violently expelled (falling damage may apply). While a
tornado&rsquo;s rotational speed can be as great as 300 mph, the funnel
itself moves forward at an average of 30 mph (roughly 250 feet per
round). A tornado uproots trees, destroys buildings, and causes other
similar forms of major destruction.
