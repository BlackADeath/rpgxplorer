      <p>Some creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do
not have an ability score of 0- they lack the ability altogether. The
modifier for a nonability is +0. Other effects of nonabilities are
detailed below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Strength:</span> Any
creature that can physically manipulate other objects has at least 1
point of Strength. A creature with no Strength score can&rsquo;t exert
force, usually because it has no physical body or because it
doesn&rsquo;t move. The creature automatically fails Strength checks.
If the creature can attack, it applies its Dexterity modifier to its
base attack bonus instead of a Strength modifier.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dexterity:</span> Any
creature that can move has at least 1 point of Dexterity. A creature
with no Dexterity score can&rsquo;t move. If it can perform actions
(such as casting spells), it applies its Intelligence modifier to
initiative checks instead of a Dexterity modifier. The creature
automatically fails Reflex saves and Dexterity checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Constitution:</span> Any
living creature has at least 1 point of Constitution. A creature with
no Constitution has no body or no metabolism. It is immune to any
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless the effect works on
objects or is harmless. The creature is also immune to ability damage,
ability drain, and energy drain, and automatically fails Constitution
checks. A creature with no Constitution cannot tire and thus can run
indefinitely without tiring (unless the creature&rsquo;s description
says it cannot run).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Intelligence:</span> Any
creature that can think, learn, or remember has at least 1 point of
Intelligence. A creature with no Intelligence score is mindless, an
automaton operating on simple instincts or programmed instructions. It
has immunity to mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects) and automatically fails Intelligence
checks.</p>
      <p>Mindless creatures do not gain feats or skills, although they may have bonus feats or racial skill bonuses.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wisdom:</span> Any creature
that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least 1 point
of Wisdom. Anything with no Wisdom score is an object, not a creature.
Anything without a Wisdom score also has no Charisma score.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Charisma:</span> Any
creature capable of telling the difference between itself and things
that are not itself has at least 1 point of Charisma. Anything with no
Charisma score is an object, not a creature. Anything without a
Charisma score also has no Wisdom score.
