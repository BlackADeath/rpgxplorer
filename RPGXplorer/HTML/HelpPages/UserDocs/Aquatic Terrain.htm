      <p>Aquatic terrain is the least hospitable to most PCs, because
they can&rsquo;t breathe there. Aquatic terrain doesn&rsquo;t offer the
variety that land terrain does. The ocean floor holds many marvels,
including undersea analogues of any of the terrain elements described
earlier in this section. But if characters find themselves in the water
because they were bull rushed off the deck of a pirate ship, the tall
kelp beds hundreds of feet below them don&rsquo;t matter. Accordingly,
these rules simply divide aquatic terrain into two categories: flowing
water (such as streams and rivers) and nonflowing water (such as lakes
and oceans).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Flowing Water:</span> Large,
placid rivers move at only a few miles per hour, so they function as
still water for most purposes. But some rivers and streams are swifter;
anything floating in them moves downstream at a speed of 10 to 40 feet
per round. The fastest rapids send swimmers bobbing downstream at 60 to
90 feet per round. Fast rivers are always at least rough water (Swim DC
15), and whitewater rapids are stormy water (Swim DC 20). If a
character is in moving water, move her downstream the indicated
distance at the end of her turn. A character trying to maintain her
position relative to the riverbank can spend some or all of her turn
swimming upstream.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swept Away:</span>
Characters swept away by a river moving 60 feet per round or faster
must make DC 20 Swim checks every round to avoid going under. If a
character gets a check result of 5 or more over the minimum necessary,
he arrests his motion by catching a rock, tree limb, or bottom snag-he
is no longer being carried along by the flow of the water. Escaping the
rapids by reaching the bank requires three DC 20 Swim checks in a row.
Characters arrested by a rock, limb, or snag can&rsquo;t escape under
their own power unless they strike out into the water and attempt to
swim their way clear. Other characters can rescue them as if they were
trapped in quicksand (described in Marsh Terrain, above).&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nonflowing Water:</span>
Lakes and oceans simply require a swim speed or successful Swim checks
to move through (DC 10 in calm water, DC 15 in rough water, DC 20 in
stormy water). Characters need a way to breathe if they&rsquo;re
underwater; failing that, they risk drowning. When underwater,
characters can move in any direction as if they were flying with
perfect maneuverability.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stealth and Detection Underwater:</span>
How far you can see underwater depends on the water&rsquo;s clarity. As
a guideline, creatures can see 4d8&times;10 feet if the water is clear,
and 1d8&times;10 feet if it&rsquo;s murky. Moving water is always
murky, unless it&rsquo;s in a particularly large, slow-moving river.</p>

      
      <p>It&rsquo;s hard to find cover or concealment to hide
underwater (except along the seafloor). Listen and Move Silently checks
function normally underwater.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Invisibility:</span> An
invisible creature displaces water and leaves a visible, body-shaped
&ldquo;bubble&rdquo; where the water was displaced. The creature still
has concealment (20% miss chance), but not total concealment (50% miss
chance).</p>

      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Underwater Combat:</span> Land-based creatures can have considerable difficulty when
fighting in water. Water affects a creature&rsquo;s Armor Class, attack
rolls, damage, and movement. In some cases a creature&rsquo;s opponents
may get a bonus on attacks. The effects are summarized in the
accompanying table. They apply whenever a character is swimming,
walking in chestdeep water, or walking along the bottom.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ranged Attacks Underwater:</span>
Thrown weapons are ineffective underwater, even when launched from
land. Attacks with other ranged weapons take a -2 penalty on attack
rolls for every 5 feet of water they pass through, in addition to the
normal penalties for range.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacks from Land:</span>
Characters swimming, floating, or treading water on the surface, or
wading in water at least chest deep, have improved cover (+8 bonus to
AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) from opponents on land. Landbound
opponents who have freedom of movement effects ignore this cover when
making melee attacks against targets in the water. A completely
submerged creature has total cover against opponents on land unless
those opponents have freedom of movement effects. Magical effects are
unaffected except for those that require attack rolls (which are
treated like any other effects) and fire effects.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fire:</span> Nonmagical fire
(including alchemist&rsquo;s fire) does not burn underwater. Spells or
spell-like effects with the fire descriptor are ineffective underwater
unless the caster makes a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level). If
the check succeeds, the spell creates a bubble of steam instead of its
usual fiery effect, but otherwise the spell works as described. A
supernatural fire effect is ineffective underwater unless its
description states otherwise. The surface of a body of water blocks
line of effect for any fire spell. If the caster has made a Spellcraft
check to make the fire spell usable underwater, the surface still
blocks the spell&rsquo;s line of effect.</p>

      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Floods:</span> In many wilderness areas, river floods are a common occurrence.</p>

      
      <p>In spring, an enormous snowmelt can engorge the streams and
rivers it feeds. Other catastrophic events such as massive rainstorms
or the destruction of a dam can create floods as well. During a flood,
rivers become wider, deeper, and swifter. Assume that a river rises by
1d10+10 feet during the spring flood, and its width increases by a
factor of 1d4&times;50%. Fords may disappear for days, bridges may be
swept away, and even ferries might not be able to manage the crossing
of a flooded river. A river in flood makes Swim checks one category
harder (calm water becomes rough, and rough water becomes stormy).
Rivers also become 50% swifter.
