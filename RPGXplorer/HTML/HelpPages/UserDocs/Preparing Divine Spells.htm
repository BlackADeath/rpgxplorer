      <p>Divine spellcasters prepare their spells in largely the same
manner as wizards do, but with a few differences. The relevant ability
for divine spells is Wisdom. To prepare a divine spell, a character
must have a Wisdom score of 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level. Likewise,
bonus spells are based on Wisdom.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time of Day:</span> A divine
spellcaster chooses and prepares spells ahead of time, just as a wizard
does. However, a divine spellcaster does not require a period of rest
to prepare spells. Instead, the character chooses a particular part of
the day to pray and receive spells. The time is usually associated with
some daily event. If some event prevents a character from praying at
the proper time, he must do so as soon as possible. If the character
does not stop to pray for spells at the first opportunity, he must wait
until the next day to prepare spells.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Selection and Preparation:</span>
A divine spellcaster selects and prepares spells ahead of time through
prayer and meditation at a particular time of day. The time required to
prepare spells is the same as it is for a wizard (1 hour), as is the
requirement for a relatively peaceful environment. A divine spellcaster
does not have to prepare all his spells at once. However, the
character&rsquo;s mind is considered fresh only during his or her first
daily spell preparation, so a divine spellcaster cannot fill a slot
that is empty because he or she has cast a spell or abandoned a
previously prepared spell.</p>
      <p>Divine spellcasters do not require spellbooks. However, such a
character&rsquo;s spell selection is limited to the spells on the list
for his or her class. Clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers have
separate spell lists. A cleric also has access to two domains
determined during his character creation. Each domain gives him access
to a domain spell at each spell level from 1st to 9th, as well as a
special granted power. With access to two domain spells at each spell
level - one from each of his two domains - a cleric must prepare, as an
extra domain spell, one or the other each day for each level of spell
he can cast. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, it can
be prepared only in a domain spell slot.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Slots:</span> The character class tables show how many spells of each level a character can cast per day.</p>
      <p>These openings for daily spells are called spell slots. A
spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level spell slot
with a lower level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high enough ability
score to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her due still gets
the slots but must fill them with spells of lower level.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent Casting Limit:</span>
As with arcane spells, at the time of preparation any spells cast
within the previous 8 hours count against the number of spells that can
be prepared.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spontaneous Casting of <span style="font-style: italic;">Cure</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">Inflict</span> Spells:</span> A good cleric (or a cleric of a good deity) can spontaneously cast a <span style="font-style: italic;">cure</span>
spell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher, but not
in place of a domain spell. An evil cleric (or a cleric of an evil
deity) can spontaneously cast an <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict</span>
spell in place of a prepared spell (one that is not a domain spell) of
the same level or higher. Each neutral cleric of a neutral deity either
spontaneously casts <span style="font-style: italic;">cure</span> spells like a good cleric or <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict</span>
spells like an evil one, depending on which option the player chooses
when creating the character. The divine energy of the spell that the <span style="font-style: italic;">cure</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict</span> spell substitutes for is converted into the <span style="font-style: italic;">cure</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">inflict</span> spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spontaneous Casting of<span style="font-style: italic;"> Summon Nature&rsquo;s Ally Spells:</span></span> A druid can spontaneously cast a <span style="font-style: italic;">summon nature&rsquo;s ally</span> spell in place of a prepared spell of the same level or higher. The divine energy of the spell that the <span style="font-style: italic;">summon nature&rsquo;s ally </span>spell substitutes for is converted into the <span style="font-style: italic;">summon</span> spell as if that spell had been prepared all along.
