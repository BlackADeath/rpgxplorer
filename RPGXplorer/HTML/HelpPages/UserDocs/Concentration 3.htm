      <p>To cast a spell, you must concentrate. If something interrupts
your concentration while you&rsquo;re casting, you must make a
Concentration check or lose the spell. The more distracting the
interruption and the higher the level of the spell you are trying to
cast, the higher the DC is. If you fail the check, you lose the spell
just as if you had cast it to no effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Injury:</span> If while
trying to cast a spell you take damage, you must make a Concentration
check (DC 10 + points of damage taken + the level of the spell
you&rsquo;re casting). If you fail the check, you lose the spell
without effect. The interrupting event strikes during spellcasting if
it comes between when you start and when you complete a spell (for a
spell with a casting time of 1 full round or more) or if it comes in
response to your casting the spell (such as an attack of opportunity
provoked by the spell or a contingent attack, such as a readied action).</p>
      <p>If you are taking continuous damage half the damage is
considered to take place while you are casting a spell. You must make a
Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous source
last dealt + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting). If the last
damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the
damage is over, and it does not distract you.</p>
      <p>Repeated damage does not count as continuous damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell:</span> If you are
affected by a spell while attempting to cast a spell of your own, you
must make a Concentration check or lose the spell you are casting. If
the spell affecting you deals damage, the DC is 10 + points of damage +
the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting.</p>
      <p>If the spell interferes with you or distracts you in some
other way, the DC is the spell&rsquo;s saving throw DC + the level of
the spell you&rsquo;re casting. For a spell with no saving throw,
it&rsquo;s the DC that the spell&rsquo;s saving throw would have if a
save were allowed.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grappling or Pinned: </span>The
only spells you can cast while grappling or pinned are those without
somatic components and whose material components (if any) you have in
hand. Even so, you must make a Concentration check (DC 20 + the level
of the spell you&rsquo;re casting) or lose the spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vigorous Motion:</span> If
you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a
small boat in rough water, below-decks in a storm-tossed ship, or
simply being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a
Concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re
casting) or lose the spell.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Violent Motion: </span>If you
are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a
small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or
being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a
Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re
casting) or lose the spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Violent Weather:</span> You
must make a Concentration check if you try to cast a spell in violent
weather. If you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the
DC is 5 + the level of the spell you&rsquo;re casting. If you are in
wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the level of the
spell you&rsquo;re casting. In either case, you lose the spell if you
fail the Concentration check. If the weather is caused by a spell, use
the rules in the Spell subsection above.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Defensively:</span>
If you want to cast a spell without provoking any attacks of
opportunity, you must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of
the spell you&rsquo;re casting) to succeed. You lose the spell if you
fail.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Entangled:</span> If you want
to cast a spell while entangled in a net or by a tanglefoot bag or
while you&rsquo;re affected by a spell with similar effects, you must
make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast the spell. You lose the spell
if you fail.
