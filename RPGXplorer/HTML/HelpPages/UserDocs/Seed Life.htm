      <p>A spell developed with the life seed will restore life and
complete vigor to any deceased creature. The condition of the remains
is not a factor. So long as some small portion of the creature&rsquo;s
body still exists, it can be returned to life, but the portion
receiving the spell must have been part of the creature&rsquo;s body at
the time of death. (The remains of a creature hit by a disintegrate
spell count as a small portion of its body.) The creature can have been
dead for no longer than two hundred years. For each additional ten
years, increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. The creature is immediately
restored to full hit points, vigor, and health, with no loss of
prepared spells. However, the subject loses one level (or 1 point of
Constitution if the subject was 1st level). The life seed cannot revive
someone who has died of old age. </p>

      
      <p>An epic caster with 24 ranks in Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge
(nature), or Knowledge (religion) can cast a spell developed with a
special version of the life seed that gives actual life to normally
inanimate objects. The caster can give inanimate plants and animals a
soul, personality, and humanlike sentience. To succeed, the caster must
make a Will save (DC 10 + the target&rsquo;s Hit Dice, or the Hit Dice
a plant will have once it comes to life).</p>

      
      <p>The newly living object, intelligent animal, or sentient plant
is friendly toward the caster. An object or plant has characteristics
as if it were an animated object, except that its Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores are all 3d6. Animated objects and plants gain the
ability to move their limbs, projections, roots, carved legs and arms,
or other appendages, and have senses similar to a human&rsquo;s. A
newly intelligent animal gets 3d6 Intelligence, +1d3 Charisma, and +2
HD. Objects, animals, and plants speak one language that the caster
knows, plus one additional language that he or she knows per point of
Intelligence bonus (if any). </p>
