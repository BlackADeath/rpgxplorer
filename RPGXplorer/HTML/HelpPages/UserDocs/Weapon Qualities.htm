      <p>Here is the format for weapon entries (given as column headings on Table: Weapons.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost:</span> This value is
the weapon&rsquo;s cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The
cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.</p>
      <p>This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage: </span>The Damage
columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The
column labeled &ldquo;Dmg (S)&rdquo; is for Small weapons. The column
labeled &ldquo;Dmg (M)&rdquo; is for Medium weapons. If two damage
ranges are given then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second
damage figure given for the double weapon&rsquo;s extra attack.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Table:</span> Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for weapons of those sizes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical:</span> The entry in
this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical
hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two,
three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using
all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results
together.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span> Extra damage over and above a weapon&rsquo;s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">x2:</span> The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">x3:</span> The weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">x3/x4:</span> One head of this double weapon deals triple damage on a critical hit. The other head deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">x4:</span> The weapon deals quadruple damage on a critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">19&ndash;20/x2:</span> The
weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just
20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat
range of 19&ndash;20.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">18&ndash;20/x2:</span> The
weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of
just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a
threat range of 18&ndash;20.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Range Increment:</span> Any
attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However,
each full range increment imposes a cumulative &ndash;2 penalty on the
attack roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range
increments. A projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight:</span> This column
gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number
for Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Type:</span> Weapons are
classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to
attacks from certain types of weapons.</p>
      <p>Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of
two types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another;
all of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune
to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.</p>
      <p>In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of
damage. In a situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder
can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details.
