      <p>Most city buildings fall into three categories. The majority
of buildings in the city are two to five stories high, built side by
side to form long rows separated by secondary or main streets. These
row houses usually have businesses on the ground floor, with offices or
apartments above.</p>
      <p>Inns, successful businesses, and large warehouses-as well as
millers, tanners, and other businesses that require extra space- are
generally large, free-standing buildings with up to five stories.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Finally, small residences, shops, warehouses, or storage sheds
are simple, one-story wooden buildings, especially if they&rsquo;re in
poorer neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Most city buildings are made of a combination of stone or clay
brick (on the lower one or two stories) and timbers (for the upper
stories, interior walls, and floors). Roofs are a mixture of boards,
thatch, and slates, sealed with pitch. A typical lower-story wall is 1
foot thick, with AC 3, hardness 8, 90 hp, and a Climb DC of 25.
Upper-story walls are 6 inches thick, with AC 3, hardness 5, 60 hp, and
a Climb DC of 21. Exterior doors on most buildings are good wooden
doors that are usually kept locked, except on public buildings such as
shops and taverns.
