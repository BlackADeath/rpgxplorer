      <p>A swarm is a collection of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures
that acts as a single creature. A swarm has the characteristics of its
type, except as noted here. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and
hit points, a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single
Armor Class. A swarm makes saving throws as a single creature. A single
swarm occupies a square (if it is made up of nonflying creatures) or a
cube (of flying creatures) 10 feet on a side, but its reach is 0 feet,
like its component creatures. In order to attack, it moves into an
opponent&rsquo;s space, which provokes an attack of opportunity. It can
occupy the same space as a creature of any size, since it crawls all
over its prey. A swarm can move through squares occupied by enemies and
vice versa without impediment, although the swarm provokes an attack of
opportunity if it does so. A swarm can move through cracks or holes
large enough for its component creatures.</p>

      
      <p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures
or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of
1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine
creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not.
Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could
normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because
creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl
over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms
are represented by multiples of single swarms. The area occupied by a
large swarm is completely shapeable, though the swarm usually remains
in contiguous squares.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Traits: </span>A swarm has
no clear front or back and no discernable anatomy, so it is not subject
to critical hits or flanking. A swarm made up of Tiny creatures takes
half damage from slashing and piercing weapons. A swarm composed of
Fine or Diminutive creatures is immune to all weapon damage. Reducing a
swarm to 0 hit points or lower causes it to break up, though damage
taken until that point does not degrade its ability to attack or resist
attack. Swarms are never staggered or reduced to a dying state by
damage. Also, they cannot be tripped, grappled, or bull rushed, and
they cannot grapple an opponent.</p>

      
      <p>A swarm is immune to any spell or effect that targets a specific number of creatures (including single-target spells such as <span style="font-style: italic;">disintegrate</span>),
with the exception of mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects) if the swarm has an
Intelligence score and a hive mind. A swarm takes half again as much
damage (+50%) from spells or effects that affect an area, such as
splash weapons and many evocation spells.</p>

      
      <p>Swarms made up of Diminutive or Fine creatures are susceptible to high winds such as that created by a <span style="font-style: italic;">gust of wind</span>
spell. For purposes of determining the effects of wind on a swarm,
treat the swarm as a creature of the same size as its constituent
creatures. A swarm rendered unconscious by means of nonlethal damage
becomes disorganized and dispersed, and does not reform until its hit
points exceed its nonlethal damage.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swarm Attack:</span>
Creatures with the swarm subtype don&rsquo;t make standard melee
attacks. Instead, they deal automatic damage to any creature whose
space they occupy at the end of their move, with no attack roll needed.
Swarm attacks are not subject to a miss chance for concealment or
cover. A swarm&rsquo;s statistics block has &ldquo;swarm&rdquo; in the
Attack and Full Attack entries, with no attack bonus given. The amount
of damage a swarm deals is based on its Hit Dice, as shown below.</p>

      <p>A swarm&rsquo;s attacks are nonmagical, unless the
swarm&rsquo;s description states otherwise. Damage reduction sufficient
to reduce a swarm attack&rsquo;s damage to 0, being incorporeal, and
other special abilities usually give a creature immunity (or at least
resistance) to damage from a swarm. Some swarms also have acid, poison,
blood drain, or other special attacks in addition to normal damage.</p>
      <p>Swarms do not threaten creatures in their square, and do not
make attacks of opportunity with their swarm attack. However, they
distract foes whose squares they occupy, as described below.</p>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Distraction (Ex):</span> Any
living creature vulnerable to a swarm&rsquo;s damage that begins its
turn with a swarm in its square is nauseated for 1 round; a Fortitude
save (DC 10 + 1/2 swarm&rsquo;s HD + swarm&rsquo;s Con modifier; the
exact DC is given in a swarm&rsquo;s description) negates the effect.
Spellcasting or concentrating on spells within the area of a swarm
requires a Concentration check (DC 20 + spell level). Using skills that
involve patience and concentration requires a DC 20 Concentration check.<br>
