      <p>Creatures smaller than Small or larger than Medium have special rules relating to position.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine Creatures:</span> Very small creatures take up less than 1 square of space.</p>
      <p>This means that more than one such creature can fit into a
single square. A Tiny creature typically occupies a space only 2-1/2
feet across, so four can fit into a single square. Twenty-five
Diminutive creatures or 100 Fine creatures can fit into a single
square. Creatures that take up less than 1 square of space typically
have a natural reach of 0 feet, meaning they can&rsquo;t reach into
adjacent squares. They must enter an opponent&rsquo;s square to attack
in melee. This provokes an attack of opportunity from the opponent. You
can attack into your own square if you need to, so you can attack such
creatures normally. Since they have no natural reach, they do not
threaten the squares around them. You can move past them without
provoking attacks of opportunity. They also can&rsquo;t flank an enemy.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Large, Huge, Gargantuan, and Colossal Creatures:</span> Very large creatures take up more than 1 square.</p>
      <p>Creatures that take up more than 1 square typically have a
natural reach of 10 feet or more, meaning that they can reach targets
even if they aren&rsquo;t in adjacent squares. Unlike when someone uses
a reach weapon, a creature with greater than normal natural reach (more
than 5 feet) still threatens squares adjacent to it. A creature with
greater than normal natural reach usually gets an attack of opportunity
against you if you approach it, because you must enter and move within
the range of its reach before you can attack it. (This attack of
opportunity is not provoked if you take a 5-foot step.)</p>
      <p>Large or larger creatures using reach weapons can strike up to
double their natural reach but can&rsquo;t strike at their natural
reach or less.&nbsp; </p>
