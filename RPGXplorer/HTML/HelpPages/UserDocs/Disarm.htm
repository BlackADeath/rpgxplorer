      <p>As a melee attack, you may attempt to disarm your opponent. If
you do so with a weapon, you knock the opponent&rsquo;s weapon out of
his hands and to the ground. If you attempt the disarm while unarmed,
you end up with the weapon in your hand.</p>

      
      <p>If you&rsquo;re attempting to disarm a melee weapon, follow
the steps outlined here. If the item you are attempting to disarm
isn&rsquo;t a melee weapon the defender may still oppose you with an
attack roll, but takes a penalty and can&rsquo;t attempt to disarm you
in return if your attempt fails.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 1:</span> Attack of
Opportunity. You provoke an attack of opportunity from the target you
are trying to disarm. (If you have the Improved Disarm feat, you
don&rsquo;t incur an attack of opportunity for making a disarm
attempt.) If the defender&rsquo;s attack of opportunity deals any
damage, your disarm attempt fails.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step 2:</span> Opposed Rolls.
You and the defender make opposed attack rolls with your respective
weapons. The wielder of a two-handed weapon on a disarm attempt gets a
+4 bonus on this roll, and the wielder of a light weapon takes a
&ndash;4 penalty. (An unarmed strike is considered a light weapon, so
you always take a penalty when trying to disarm an opponent by using an
unarmed strike.) If the combatants are of different sizes, the larger
combatant gets a bonus on the attack roll of +4 per difference in size
category. If the targeted item isn&rsquo;t a melee weapon, the defender
takes a &ndash;4 penalty on the roll.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Step Three:</span>
Consequences. If you beat the defender, the defender is disarmed. If
you attempted the disarm action unarmed, you now have the weapon. If
you were armed, the defender&rsquo;s weapon is on the ground in the
defender&rsquo;s square.</p>

      
      <p>If you fail on the disarm attempt, the defender may
immediately react and attempt to disarm you with the same sort of
opposed melee attack roll. His attempt does not provoke an attack of
opportunity from you. If he fails his disarm attempt, you do not
subsequently get a free disarm attempt against him.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> A defender
wearing spiked gauntlets can&rsquo;t be disarmed. A defender using a
weapon attached to a locked gauntlet gets a +10 bonus to resist being
disarmed.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grabbing Items</span><br>
You can use a disarm action to snatch an item worn by the target. If
you want to have the item in your hand, the disarm must be made as an
unarmed attack.</p>
      <p>If the item is poorly secured or otherwise easy to snatch or
cut away the attacker gets a +4 bonus. Unlike on a normal disarm
attempt, failing the attempt doesn&rsquo;t allow the defender to
attempt to disarm you. This otherwise functions identically to a disarm
attempt, as noted above.</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t snatch an item that is well secured unless you
have pinned the wearer (see Grapple). Even then, the defender gains a
+4 bonus on his roll to resist the attempt.</p>
