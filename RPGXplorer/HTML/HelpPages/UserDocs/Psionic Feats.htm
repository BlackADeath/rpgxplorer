				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Psionic feats are available
only to characters and creatures with the ability to manifest powers.
(In other words, they either have a power point reserve or have
psi-like abilities.)<br>
Because psionic feats are supernatural abilities - a departure from the
general rule that feats do not grant supernatural abilities - they
cannot be disrupted in combat (as powers can be) and generally do not
provoke attacks of opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions).
Supernatural abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot
be dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is
suppressed, such as a null psionics field. Leaving such an area
immediately allows psionic feats to be used.<br>
Many psionic feats can be used only when you are psionically focused;
others require you to expend your psionic focus to gain their benefit.
Expending your psionic focus does not require an action; it is part of
another action (such as using a feat). When you expend your psionic
focus, it applies only to the action for which you expended it.<br>
