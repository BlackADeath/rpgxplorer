      <p>Sometimes, masonry walls-stones piled on top of each other
(usually but not always held in place with mortar)-divide dungeons into
corridors and chambers. Dungeon walls can also be hewn from solid rock,
leaving them with a rough, chiseled look. Or, dungeon walls can be the
smooth, unblemished stone of a naturally occurring cave. Dungeon walls
are difficult to break down or through, but they&rsquo;re generally
easy to climb.</p>

      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Masonry Walls:</span> The most
common kind of dungeon wall, masonry walls are usually at least 1 foot
thick. Often these ancient walls sport cracks and crevices, and
sometimes dangerous slimes or small monsters live in these areas and
wait for prey. Masonry walls stop all but the loudest noises. It takes
a DC 20 Climb check to travel along a masonry wall.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Superior Masonry Walls:</span>
Sometimes masonry walls are better built (smoother, with
tighter-fitting stones and less cracking), and occasionally these
superior walls are covered with plaster or stucco. Covered walls often
bear paintings, carved reliefs, or other decoration. Superior masonry
walls are no more difficult to destroy than regular masonry walls but
are more difficult to climb (DC 25).<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hewn Stone Walls:</span> Such
walls usually result when a chamber or passage is tunneled out from
solid rock. The rough surface of a hewn wall frequently provides
minuscule ledges where fungus grows and fissures where vermin, bats,
and subterranean snakes live. When such a wall has an &ldquo;other
side&rdquo; (it separates two chambers in the dungeon), the wall is
usually at least 3 feet thick; anything thinner risks collapsing from
the weight of all the stone overhead. It takes a DC 25 Climb check to
climb a hewn stone wall.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unworked Stone Walls:</span>
These surfaces are uneven and rarely flat. They are smooth to the touch
but filled with tiny holes, hidden alcoves, and ledges at various
heights. They&rsquo;re also usually wet or at least damp, since
it&rsquo;s water that most frequently creates natural caves. When such
a wall has an &ldquo;other side,&rdquo; the wall is usually at least 5
feet thick. It takes a DC 15 Climb check to move along an unworked
stone wall.
