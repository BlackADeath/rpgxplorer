      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slippery: </span>Water, ice,
slime, or blood can make any of the dungeon floors described in this
section more treacherous. Slippery floors increase the DC of Balance
and Tumble checks by 5.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grate:</span> A grate often
covers a pit or an area lower than the main floor. Grates are usually
made from iron, but large ones can also be made from iron-bound
timbers. Many grates have hinges to allow access to what lies below
(such grates can be locked like any door), while others are permanent
and designed not to move. A typical 1-inch-thick iron grate has 25 hit
points, hardness 10, and a DC of 27 for Strength checks to break
through it or tear it loose.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ledge:</span> Ledges allow
creatures to walk above some lower area. They often circle around pits,
run along underground streams, form balconies around large rooms, or
provide a place for archers to stand while firing upon enemies below.
Narrow ledges (12 inches wide or less) require those moving along them
to make Balance checks. Failure results in the moving character falling
off the ledge. Ledges sometimes have railings. In such a case,
characters gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Balance checks to move along
the ledge. A character who is next to a railing gains a +2 circumstance
bonus on his or her opposed Strength check to avoid being bull rushed
off the edge.</p>
      <p>Ledges can also have low walls 2 to 3 feet high along their
edges. Such walls provide cover against attackers within 30 feet on the
other side of the wall, as long as the target is closer to the low wall
than the attacker is.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Transparent Floor:</span>
Transparent floors, made of reinforced glass or magic materials (even a
wall of force), allow a dangerous setting to be viewed safely from
above. Transparent floors are sometimes placed over lava pools, arenas,
monster dens, and torture chambers. They can be used by defenders to
watch key areas for intruders.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sliding Floors:</span> A
sliding floor is a type of trapdoor, designed to be moved and thus
reveal something that lies beneath it. A typical sliding floor moves so
slowly that anyone standing on one can avoid falling into the gap it
creates, assuming there&rsquo;s somewhere else to go. If such a floor
slides quickly enough that there&rsquo;s a chance of a character
falling into whatever lies beneath-a spiked pit, a vat of burning oil,
or a pool filled with sharks-then it&rsquo;s a trap.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trap Floors:</span> Some
floors are designed to become suddenly dangerous. With the application
of just the right amount of weight, or the pull of a lever somewhere
nearby, spikes protrude from the floor, gouts of steam or flame shoot
up from hidden holes, or the entire floor tilts. These strange floors
are sometimes found in an arena, designed to make combats more exciting
and deadly. Construct these floors as you would any other trap.&nbsp;
