				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">An action&rsquo;s type
essentially tells you how long the action takes to perform (within the
framework of the 6-second combat round) and how movement is treated.
There are four types of actions: standard actions, move actions,
full-round actions, and free actions.<br>
      <br>
In a normal round, you can perform a standard action and a move action,
or you can perform a full-round action. You can also perform one or
more free actions. You can always take a move action in place of a
standard action.<br>
      <br>
In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Action:</span> A standard action allows you to do something, most commonly make an attack or cast a spell.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Move Action:</span> A move action allows you to move your speed or perform an action that takes a similar amount of time.<br>
      <br>
You can take a move action in place of a standard action. If you move
no actual distance in a round (commonly because you have swapped your
move for one or more equivalent actions), you can take one 5-foot step
either before, during, or after the action.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Full-Round Action:</span> A
full-round action consumes all your effort during a round. The only
movement you can take during a full-round action is a 5-foot step
before, during, or after the action. You can also perform free actions
(see below).<br>
      <br>
Some full-round actions do not allow you to take a 5-foot step.<br>
      <br>
Some full-round actions can be taken as standard actions, but only in
situations when you are limited to performing only a standard action
during your round. The descriptions of specific actions, below, detail
which actions allow this option.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Free Action:</span> Free actions
consume a very small amount of time and effort. You can perform one or
more free actions while taking another action normally. However, there
are reasonable limits on what you can really do for free.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Not an Action:</span> Some
activities are so minor that they are not even considered free actions.
They literally don&rsquo;t take any time at all to do and are
considered an inherent part of doing something else.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Restricted Activity:</span> In
some situations, you may be unable to take a full round&rsquo;s worth
of actions. In such cases, you are restricted to taking only a single
standard action or a single move action (plus free actions as normal).
You can&rsquo;t take a full-round action (though you can start or
complete a full-round action by using a standard action).</td>
