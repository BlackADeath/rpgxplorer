      <p>Rooms in dungeons vary in shape and size. Although many are
simple in construction and appearance, particularly interesting rooms
have multiple levels joined by stairs, ramps, or ladders, as well as
statuary, altars, pits, chasms, bridges, and more.</p>

      
      <p>Underground chambers are prone to collapse, so many rooms-
particularly large ones-have arched ceilings or pillars to support the
weight of the rock overhead.<br>

Common dungeon rooms fall into the following broad categories.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Guard Post:</span>
Intelligent, social denizens of the dungeon will generally have a
series of adjacent rooms they consider &ldquo;theirs,&rdquo; and
they&rsquo;ll guard the entrances to that common area.</p>

      
      <p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Living Quarters:</span> All but
the most nomadic creatures have a lair where they can rest, eat, and
store their treasure. Living quarters commonly include beds (if the
creature sleeps), possessions (both valuable and mundane), and some
sort of food preparation area. Noncombatant creatures such as juveniles
and the elderly are often found here.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Work Area:</span> Most
intelligent creatures do more than just guard, eat, and sleep, and many
devote rooms to magic laboratories, workshops for weapons and armor, or
studios for more esoteric tasks.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shrine:</span> Any creature
that is particularly religious may have some place dedicated to
worship, and others may venerate something of great historical or
personal value. Depending on the creature&rsquo;s resources and piety,
a shrine can be humble or extensive. A shrine is where PCs will likely
encounter NPC clerics, and it&rsquo;s common for wounded monsters to
flee to a shrine friendly to them when they seek healing.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vault:</span> Well protected,
often by a locked iron door, a vault is a special room that contains
treasure. There&rsquo;s usually only one entrance-an appropriate place
for a trap.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crypt:</span> Although
sometimes constructed like a vault, a crypt can also be a series of
individual rooms, each with its own sarcophagus, or a long hall with
recesses on either side-shelves to hold coffins or bodies.</p>

      
      <p>Those who are worried about undead rising from the grave take
the precaution of locking and trapping a crypt from the outside- making
the crypt easy to get into but difficult to leave. Those worried about
tomb robbers make their crypts difficult to get into. Some builders do
both, just to be on the safe side.
