      <p>To manifest a power, you must concentrate. If something
threatens to interrupt your concentration while you&rsquo;re
manifesting a power, you must succeed on a Concentration check or lose
the power points without manifesting the power. The more distracting
the interruption and the higher the level of the power that you are
trying to manifest, the higher the DC. (Higher-level powers require
more mental effort.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Injury:</span> Getting hurt
or being affected by hostile psionics while trying to manifest a power
can break your concentration and ruin a power. If you take damage while
trying to manifest a power, you must make a Concentration check (DC 10
+ points of damage taken + the level of the power you&rsquo;re
manifesting). The interrupting event strikes during manifestation if it
occurs between when you start and when you complete manifesting a power
(for a power with a manifesting time of 1 round or longer) or if it
comes in response to your manifesting the power (such as an attack of
opportunity provoked by the manifesting of the power or a contingent
attack from a readied action).</p>
      <p>If you are taking continuous damage half the damage is
considered to take place while you are manifesting a power. You must
make a Concentration check (DC 10 + 1/2 the damage that the continuous
source last dealt + the level of the power you&rsquo;re manifesting).</p>
      <p>If the last damage dealt was the last damage that the effect could deal then the damage is over, and it does not distract you.</p>
      <p>Repeated damage does not count as continuous damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power:</span> If you are
affected by a power while attempting to manifest a power of your own,
you must make a Concentration check or lose the power you are
manifesting. If the power affecting you deals damage, the Concentration
DC is 10 + points of damage + the level of the power you&rsquo;re
manifesting. If the power interferes with you or distracts you in some
other way, the Concentration DC is the power&rsquo;s save DC + the
level of the power you&rsquo;re manifesting. For a power with no saving
throw, it&rsquo;s the DC that the power&rsquo;s saving throw would have
if a save were allowed.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grappling or Pinned:</span>
To manifest a power while grappling or pinned, you must make a
Concentration check (DC 20 + the level of the power you&rsquo;re
manifesting) or lose the power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vigorous Motion:</span> If
you are riding on a moving mount, taking a bouncy ride in a wagon, on a
small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a storm-tossed ship, or simply
being jostled in a similar fashion, you must make a Concentration check
(DC 10 + the level of the power you&rsquo;re manifesting) or lose the
power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Violent Motion:</span> If you
are on a galloping horse, taking a very rough ride in a wagon, on a
small boat in rapids or in a storm, on deck in a storm-tossed ship, or
being tossed roughly about in a similar fashion, you must make a
Concentration check (DC 15 + the level of the power you&rsquo;re
manifesting) or lose the power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Violent Weather:</span> If
you are in a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet, the DC is 5 +
the level of the power you&rsquo;re manifesting. If you are in
wind-driven hail, dust, or debris, the DC is 10 + the level of the
power you&rsquo;re manifesting. In either case, you lose the power if
you fail the Concentration check. If the weather is caused by a power,
use the rules in the Power subsection above.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Powers on the Defensive:</span>
If you want to manifest a power without provoking attacks of
opportunity, you need to dodge and weave. You must make a Concentration
check (DC 15 + the level of the power you&rsquo;re manifesting) to
succeed. You lose the power points without successful manifestation if
you fail.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Entangled:</span> If you want
to manifest a power while entangled in a net or while affected by a
power with similar effects you must make a DC 15 Concentration check to
manifest the power. You lose the power if you fail.</p>
