      <p>Illusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They
cause people to see things that are not there, not see things that are
there, hear phantom noises, or remember things that never happened.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Figment:</span> A figment
spell creates a false sensation. Those who perceive the figment
perceive the same thing, not their own slightly different versions of
the figment. (It is not a personalized mental impression.) Figments
cannot make something seem to be something else. A figment that
includes audible effects cannot duplicate intelligible speech unless
the spell description specifically says it can. If intelligible speech
is possible, it must be in a language you can speak. If you try to
duplicate a language you cannot speak, the image produces gibberish.
Likewise, you cannot make a visual copy of something unless you know
what it looks like.</p>
      <p>Because figments and glamers (see below) are unreal, they
cannot produce real effects the way that other types of illusions can.
They cannot cause damage to objects or creatures, support weight,
provide nutrition, or provide protection from the elements.
Consequently, these spells are useful for confounding or delaying foes,
but useless for attacking them directly.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A figment&rsquo;s AC is equal to 10 + its size modifier.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Glamer:</span> A glamer spell
changes a subject&rsquo;s sensory qualities, making it look, feel,
taste, smell, or sound like something else, or even seem to disappear.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pattern:</span> Like a
figment, a pattern spell creates an image that others can see, but a
pattern also affects the minds of those who see it or are caught in it.
All patterns are mind-affecting spells.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Phantasm:</span> A phantasm
spell creates a mental image that usually only the caster and the
subject (or subjects) of the spell can perceive. This impression is
totally in the minds of the subjects. It is a personalized mental
impression. (It&rsquo;s all in their heads and not a fake picture or
something that they actually see.) Third parties viewing or studying
the scene don&rsquo;t notice the phantasm. All phantasms are
mind-affecting spells.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shadow:</span> A shadow spell
creates something that is partially real from extradimensional energy.
Such illusions can have real effects. Damage dealt by a shadow illusion
is real.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throws and Illusions (Disbelief):</span>
Creatures encountering an illusion usually do not receive saving throws
to recognize it as illusory until they study it carefully or interact
with it in some fashion.</p>
      <p>A successful saving throw against an illusion reveals it to be
false, but a figment or phantasm remains as a translucent outline.</p>
      <p>A failed saving throw indicates that a character fails to
notice something is amiss. A character faced with proof that an
illusion isn&rsquo;t real needs no saving throw. If any viewer
successfully disbelieves an illusion and communicates this fact to
others, each such viewer gains a saving throw with a +4 bonus.
