      <p>Manifesters can use their personal power to create lasting
psionic items. Doing so, however, is draining. A manifester must put a
little of himself or herself into every psionic item he or she creates.</p>
      <p>A psionic item creation feat lets a manifester create a
psionic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of items they
involve, the various item creation feats all have certain features in
common.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">XP Cost: </span>Power and
energy that the manifester would normally keep is expended when making
a psionic item. The experience point cost of using a psionic item
creation feat equals 1/25 the cost of the item in gold pieces. A
character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she loses a
level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level, he or she
can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than keeping the
XP to advance a level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Raw Materials Cost:</span>
Creating a psionic item requires costly components, most of which are
consumed in the process. The cost of these materials equals 1/2 the
cost of the item.</p>
      <p>Using a psionic item creation feat also requires access to a
laboratory or psionic workshop, special tools, and other equipment. A
character generally has access to what he or she needs unless unusual
circumstances apply (such as if he&rsquo;s traveling far from home).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time:</span> The time to create a psionic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Item Cost:</span> Craft
Dorje, Imprint Stone, and Scribe Tattoo create items that directly
reproduce the effects of powers, and the strength of these items
depends on their manifester level - that is, a power from such an item
has the strength it would have if manifested by a manifester of that
level. Often, that is the minimum manifester level necessary to
manifest the power. (Randomly discovered items usually follow this
rule.) However, when making such an item, the item&rsquo;s strength can
be set higher than the minimum. Any time a character creates an item
using a power augmented by spending additional power points, the
character&rsquo;s effective manifester level for the purpose of
calculating the item&rsquo;s cost increases by 1 for each 1 additional
power point spent. (Augmentation is a feature of many powers that
allows the power to be amplified in various ways if additional power
points are spent.) All other level-dependent parameters of the power
forged into the item are set according to the effective manifester
level.</p>
      <p>The price of psionic items (and thus the XP cost and the cost
of the raw materials) depends on the level of the power and a
character&rsquo;s manifester level. The character&rsquo;s manifester
level must be high enough that the item creator can manifest the power
at the chosen level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the
character&rsquo;s manifester level by the power level, then multiply
the result by a constant, as shown below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Power Stones:</span> Base price = power level x manifester level x 25 gp</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Psionic Tattoos:</span> Base price = power level x manifester level x 50 gp</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dorjes:</span> Base price = power level x manifester level x 750 gp</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Costs: </span>Any dorje, power stone, or psionic tattoo that stores a power with an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. </p>
      <p>For psionic tattoos and power stones, the creator must pay the
XP cost when creating the item. For a dorje, the creator must pay fifty
times the XP cost. </p>
      <p>Some psionic items similarly incur extra costs in XP, as noted in their descriptions.</p>
