					<P>Many abilities and spells can cloud the minds of characters and monsters,
					  leaving them unable to tell friend from foe&#8212;or worse yet, deceiving
					  them into thinking that their former friends are now their worst enemies.
					  Two general types of enchantments affect characters and creatures: charms
				  and compulsions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </P>
					<P>Charming another creature gives the charming character
					  the ability to befriend and suggest courses of actions
					    to his minion, but the servitude is not absolute or mindless.
					  Charms of this type include
					  the various <em>charm</em> spells. Essentially, a <em>charmed</em> character
					    retains free will but makes choices according to a skewed
					  view of the world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      </P>

			      language.</li>
					  <li> A <em>charmed</em> character retains his original alignment
					    and allegiances, generally with the exception that he now regards the <em>charming </em> creature
					    as a dear friend and will give great weight to his suggestions and directions.</li>
					  <li> A <em>charmed</em> character fights his former allies only
					    if they threaten his new friend, and even then he uses the least lethal
					    means
					            at his disposal as long as these tactics show
					    any possibility of success (just as he would in a fight between two
					    actual friends). </li>
					  <li> A <em>charmed</em> character is entitled to an opposed Charisma
					              check against his master in order to resist
					    instructions or commands that would make him do something he wouldn&#8217;t
					    normally do even for a close friend. If he succeeds, he decides not
					    to go along with that order but
		              remains <em>charmed</em>.</li>
					  <li> A <em>charmed</em> character never obeys a command that is
					    obviously suicidal or grievously harmful to her. </li>
					  <li> If the <em>charming</em> creature commands his minion to do
					    something that the influenced character would be violently opposed to,
					    the subject
	                  may attempt a new saving throw to break free of the influence
					    altogether.</li>
					  <li> A <em>charmed</em> character who is openly attacked by the
					    creature who charmed him or by that creature&#8217;s apparent allies
					    is automatically freed of the spell or effect. </li>
				  </ul>					<P>Compulsion is a different matter altogether.
					                A compulsion overrides the subject&#8217;s free will in
					                some way or simply changes the way the subject&#8217;s mind
					                works. A charm makes the subject a friend of the caster;
					                a compulsion makes the subject obey the caster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </P>
