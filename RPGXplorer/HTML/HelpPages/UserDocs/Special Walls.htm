      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reinforced Walls:</span>
These are masonry walls with iron bars on one or both sides of the
wall, or placed within the wall to strengthen it. The hardness of a
reinforced wall remains the same, but its hit points are doubled and
the Strength check DC to break through it is increased by 10.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Iron Walls:</span> These walls are placed within dungeons around important places such as vaults.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Paper Walls:</span> Paper walls are the opposite of iron walls, placed as screens to block line of sight but nothing more.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden Walls:</span> Wooden
walls often exist as recent additions to older dungeons, used to create
animal pens, storage bins, or just to make a number of smaller rooms
out of a larger one.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Magically Treated Walls:</span>
These walls are stronger than average, with a greater hardness, more
hit points, and a higher break DC. Magic can usually double the
hardness and hit points and can add up to 20 to the break DC. A
magically treated wall also gains a saving throw against spells that
could affect it, with the save bonus equaling 2 + one-half the caster
level of the magic reinforcing the wall. Creating a magic wall requires
the Craft Wondrous Item feat and the expenditure of 1,500 gp for each
10 foot-by-10-foot wall section.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Walls with Arrow Slits:</span>
Walls with arrow slits can be made of any durable material but are most
commonly masonry, hewn stone, or wood. Such a wall allows defenders to
fire arrows or crossbow bolts at intruders from behind the safety of
the wall. Archers behind arrow slits have improved cover that gives
them a +8 bonus to Armor Class, a +4 bonus on Reflex saves, and the
benefits of the improved evasion class feature.
