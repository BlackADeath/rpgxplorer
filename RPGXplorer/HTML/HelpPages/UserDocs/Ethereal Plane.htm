      <p>The Ethereal Plane is coexistent with the Material Plane and
often other planes as well. The Material Plane itself is visible from
the Ethereal Plane, but it appears muted and indistinct, its colors
blurring into each other and its edges turning fuzzy.</p>

      
      
      <p>While it is possible to see into the Material Plane from the
Ethereal Plane, the Ethereal Plane is usually invisible to those on the
Material Plane. Normally, creatures on the Ethereal Plane cannot attack
creatures on the Material Plane, and vice versa. A traveler on the
Ethereal Plane is invisible, incorporeal, and utterly silent to someone
on the Material Plane.<br>
      <br>

The Ethereal Plane is mostly empty of structures and impediments.
However, the plane has its own inhabitants. Some of these are other
ethereal travelers, but the ghosts found here pose a particular peril
to those who walk the fog.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>It has the following traits.</p>

      
      <ul>

        <li>No gravity.</li>

        <li>Alterable morphic. The plane contains little to alter, however.</li>

        <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>

        <li>Normal magic. Spells function normally on the Ethereal Plane, though they do not cross into the Material Plane.&nbsp;</li>

      
      </ul>

      
      <p>The only exceptions are spells and spell-like abilities that
have the force descriptor and abjuration spells that affect ethereal
beings. Spellcasters on the Material Plane must have some way to detect
foes on the Ethereal Plane before targeting them with force-based
spells, of course. While it&rsquo;s possible to hit ethereal enemies
with a force spell cast on the Material Plane, the reverse isn&rsquo;t
possible. No magical attacks cross from the Ethereal Plane to the
Material Plane, including force attacks.<br>
