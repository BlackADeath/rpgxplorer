      <p>A deity of rank 1 or higher can understand, speak, and read
any language, including nonverbal languages. The deity can speak
directly to any beings within one mile of itself per divine rank.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Remote Communication:</span>
As a standard action, a deity of rank 1 or higher can send a
communication to a remote location. The deity can speak to any of its
own worshipers, and to anyone within one mile per rank away from a site
dedicated to the deity, or within one mile per rank away from a statue
or other likeness of the deity. The creature being contacted can
receive a telepathic message that only it can hear. Alternatively, the
deity&rsquo;s voice can seem to issue from the air, the ground, or from
some object of the deity&rsquo;s choosing (but not an object or locale
dedicated to another deity of equal or higher rank than the deity who
is speaking). In the latter case, anyone within earshot of the sound
can hear it. The deity can send a manifestation or omen instead of a
spoken or telepathic message. The exact nature of this communication
varies with the deity, but it usually is some visible phenomenon. A
deity&rsquo;s communication power can cross planes and penetrate any
barrier. Once communication is initiated, the deity can continue
communicating as a free action until it decides to end the
communication. A deity can carry on as many remote communications at
one time as it can remote sense at one time (see Remote Sensing, above).&nbsp;</p>
