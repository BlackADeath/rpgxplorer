      <p>When a character contracts lycanthropy through a
lycanthrope&rsquo;s bite (see above), no symptoms appear until the
first night of the next full moon. On that night, the afflicted
character involuntarily assumes animal form and forgets his or her own
identity, temporarily becoming an NPC. The character remains in animal
form, assuming the appropriate alignment, until the next dawn.</p>
      <p>The character&rsquo;s actions during this first episode are
dictated by the alignment of its animal form. The character remembers
nothing about the entire episode (or subsequent episodes) unless he
succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom check, in which case he becomes aware of his
lycanthropic condition.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, the character is subject to involuntary
transformation under the full moon and whenever damaged in combat. He
or she feels an overwhelming rage building up and must succeed on a
Control Shape check (see below) to resist changing into animal form.
Any player character not yet aware of his or her lycanthropic condition
temporarily becomes an NPC during an involuntary change, and acts
according to the alignment of his or her animal form.</p>
      <p>A character with awareness of his condition retains his
identity and does not lose control of his actions if he changes.
However, each time he changes to his animal form, he must make a Will
save (DC 15 + number of times he has been in animal form) or
permanently assume the alignment of his animal form in all shapes.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Once a character becomes aware of his affliction, he can now
voluntarily attempt to change to animal or hybrid form, using the
appropriate Control Shape check DC. An attempt is a standard action and
can be made each round. Any voluntary change to animal or hybrid form
immediately and permanently changes the character&rsquo;s alignment to
that of the appropriate lycanthrope.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing Form: </span>Changing
form is a standard action. If the change is involuntary, the character
performs the change on his next turn following the triggering event.
Changing to animal or hybrid form ruins the character&rsquo;s armor and
clothing (including any items worn) if the new form is larger than the
character&rsquo;s natural form; carried items are simply dropped.
Characters can hastily doff clothing while changing, but not armor.
Magic armor survives the change if it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude
save. An afflicted character who is not aware of his condition remains
in animal form until the next dawn. An afflicted character who is aware
of his or her condition (see above) can try to resume humanoid form
following a change (voluntary or involuntary) with a Control Shape
check, but if he fails his check, he remains in animal (or hybrid) form
until the following dawn.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Curing Lycanthropy: </span>An
afflicted character who eats a sprig of belladonna (also called
wolfsbane) within 1 hour of a lycanthrope&rsquo;s attack can attempt a
DC 20 Fortitude save to shake off the affliction. If a healer
administers the herb, use the character&rsquo;s save bonus or the
healer&rsquo;s Heal modifier, whichever is higher. The character gets
only one chance, no matter how much belladonna is consumed. The
belladonna must be reasonably fresh (picked within the last week).</p>
      <p>However, fresh or not, belladonna is toxic. The character must
succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Strength
damage. One minute later, the character must succeed on a second DC 13
save or take an additional 2d6 points of Strength damage.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A <span style="font-style: italic;">remove disease</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">heal </span>spell
cast by a cleric of 12th level or higher also cures the affliction,
provided the character receives the spell within three days of the
lycanthrope&rsquo;s attack.</p>
      <p>The only other way to remove the affliction is to cast <span style="font-style: italic;">remove curse</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">break enchantment </span>on
the character during one of the three days of the full moon. After
receiving the spell, the character must succeed on a DC 20 Will save to
break the curse (the caster knows if the spell works). If the save
fails, the process must be repeated.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Characters undergoing this cure are often kept bound or confined in cages until the cure takes effect.</p>
      <p>Only afflicted lycanthropes can be cured of lycanthropy.
