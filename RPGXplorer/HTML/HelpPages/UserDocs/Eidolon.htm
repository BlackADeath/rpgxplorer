      <p>Upon casting eidolon, the character creates a duplicate
version of him or her self as the character was when he or she was a
21st-level character, and the character gains one negative level while
the duplicate persists. For each additional negative level the
character bestow upon him or her self at the time of casting, the
eidolon has one additional character level. No matter how many negative
levels the character bestows on him or her self, the eidolon can never
have more character levels than the character has (taking the negative
levels into account). Treat the duplicate as the character with a
number of negative levels conferred that would lower him or her to the
character level of the eidolon. The eidolon is considered fresh and
rested when created. It may cast any spell the character has access to,
including an epic spell. Use the eidolon&rsquo;s Spellcraft modifier as
the basis for the number of epic spells it can cast in a day, and its
effective character level as a basis for its skills, feats, and other
abilities. The eidolon is effectively lower level than the character
and probably can&rsquo;t cast all the spells he or she knows. A
powerful enough eidolon might conceivably cast the eidolon spell
itself. The eidolon appears in whatever mundane clothing the character
desires when initially conjured, but it has no other possessions. It
shares part of the character&rsquo;s soul, so it is the character for
all intents and purposes. The character and his or her eidolon
communicate with each other normally. Usually, the eidolon does not
begrudge its brief existence, because it is still part of the
character. If the eidolon is killed prior to the expiration of the
spell&rsquo;s duration, the character immediately regains the lost
levels. Normally, the eidolon does not last long enough to threaten the
character with permanent level drain. </p>
