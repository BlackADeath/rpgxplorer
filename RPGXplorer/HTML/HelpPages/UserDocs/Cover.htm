      <p>To determine whether your target has cover from your ranged
attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to
any corner of the target&rsquo;s square passes through a square or
border that blocks line of effect or provides cover, or through a
square occupied by a creature, the target has cover (+4 to AC).</p>
      <p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your
target has cover if any line from your square to the target&rsquo;s
square goes through a wall (including a low wall). When making a melee
attack against a target that isn&rsquo;t adjacent to you (such as with
a reach weapon), use the rules for determining cover from ranged
attacks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Low Obstacles and Cover:</span>
A low obstacle (such as a wall no higher than half your height)
provides cover, but only to creatures within 30 feet (6 squares) of it.
The attacker can ignore the cover if he&rsquo;s closer to the obstacle
than his target.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cover and Attacks of Opportunity:</span> You can&rsquo;t execute an attack of opportunity against an opponent with cover relative to you.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cover and Reflex Saves:</span>
Cover grants you a +2 bonus on Reflex saves against attacks that
originate or burst out from a point on the other side of the cover from
you. Note that spread effects can extend around corners and thus negate
this cover bonus.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cover and Hide Checks:</span> You can use cover to make a Hide check. Without cover, you usually need concealment (see below) to make a Hide check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Soft Cover:</span> Creatures,
even your enemies, can provide you with cover against ranged attacks,
giving you a +4 bonus to AC. However, such soft cover provides no bonus
on Reflex saves, nor does soft cover allow you to make a Hide check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Big Creatures and Cover:</span>
Any creature with a space larger than 5 feet (1 square) determines
cover against melee attacks slightly differently than smaller creatures
do. Such a creature can choose any square that it occupies to determine
if an opponent has cover against its melee attacks. Similarly, when
making a melee attack against such a creature, you can pick any of the
squares it occupies to determine if it has cover against you.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Cover:</span> If you
don&rsquo;t have line of effect to your target he is considered to have
total cover from you. You can&rsquo;t make an attack against a target
that has total cover.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Varying Degrees of Cover:</span>
In some cases, cover may provide a greater bonus to AC and Reflex
saves. In such situations the normal cover bonuses to AC and Reflex
saves can be doubled (to +8 and +4, respectively). A creature with this
improved cover effectively gains improved evasion against any attack to
which the Reflex save bonus applies. Furthermore, improved cover
provides a +10 bonus on Hide checks.
