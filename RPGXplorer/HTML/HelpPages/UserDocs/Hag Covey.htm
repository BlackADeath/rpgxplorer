      <p>From time to time, a trio of hags gathers as a covey. Usually
this foul triune includes one hag of each type, but this is not always
the case.</p>
      <p>Combat: Hags in a covey rely on deception and their boosted magical abilities in combat.</p>
      <p>A covey of hags is 80% likely to be guarded by 1d8 ogres and
1d4 evil giants who do their bidding. These minions are often disguised
with a veil spell to appear less threatening and sent forth as spies.
Such minions often (60%) carry magic stones known as hag eyes (see
below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell-Like Abilities:</span> 3/day - <span style="font-style: italic;">animate dead, bestow curse</span> (DC 17), <span style="font-style: italic;">control weather, dream, forcecage, mind blank, mirage arcana</span> (DC 18), <span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph, veil</span> (DC 19),<span style="font-style: italic;"> vision.</span>
Caster level 9th. The save DCs are based on a Charisma score of 16. To
use one of these abilities (which requires a full-round action), all
three hags must be within 10 feet of one another, and all must
participate.</p>
      <p>Once per month, a covey that does not have a <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span> can create one from a gem worth at least 20 gp (see below).<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hag Eye: </span>A <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span> is a magic gem created by a covey. It appears to be nothing more than a semiprecious stone, but a <span style="font-style: italic;">gem of seeing</span> or other such effect reveals it as a disembodied eye. Often, a <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span> is worn as a ring, brooch, or other adornment. Any of the three hags who created the <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span> can see through it whenever they wish, so long as it is on the same plane of existence as the hag. A <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span> has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. Destroying a <span style="font-style: italic;">hag eye</span>
deals 1d10 points of damage to each member of the covey and causes the
one who sustained the greatest damage to be blinded for 24 hours.&nbsp;
