      <p>Combat is cyclical; everybody acts in turn in a regular cycle of rounds. Combat follows this sequence:</p>

      
1. Each combatant starts out flat-footed. Once a combatant acts, he or she is no longer flat-footed.<br>

2. Determine which characters are aware of their opponents at the start
of the battle. If some but not all of the combatants are aware of their
opponents, a surprise round happens before regular rounds of combat
begin. The combatants who are aware of the opponents can act in the
surprise round, so they roll for initiative. In initiative order
(highest to lowest), combatants who started the battle aware of their
opponents each take one action (either a standard action or a move
action) during the surprise round. Combatants who were unaware do not
get to act in the surprise round. If no one or everyone starts the
battle aware, there is no surprise round.<br>

3. Combatants who have not yet rolled initiative do so. All combatants
are now ready to begin their first regular round of combat.<br>

4. Combatants act in initiative order (highest to lowest).<br>

5. When everyone has had a turn, the combatant with the highest
initiative acts again, and steps 4 and 5 repeat until combat ends.
