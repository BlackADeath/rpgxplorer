      <p>Psionic characters manifest powers, which involve the direct
manipulation of personal mental energy. These manipulations require
natural talent and personal meditation. A psionic character&rsquo;s
level limits the number of power points available to manifest powers. A
psionic character&rsquo;s relevant high score might allow him to gain
extra power points. He can manifest the same power more than once, but
each manifestation subtracts power points from his daily limit.
Manifesting a power is an arduous mental task. To do so, a psionic
character must have a key ability score of at least 10 + the
power&rsquo;s level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Daily Power Point Acquisition:</span>
To regain used daily power points, a psionic character must have a
clear mind. To clear his mind, he must first sleep for 8 hours. The
character does not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but he
must refrain from movement, combat, manifesting powers, skill use,
conversation, or any other demanding physical or mental task during the
rest period. If his rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour
to the total amount of time he has to rest to clear his mind, and he
must have at least 1 hour of rest immediately prior to regaining lost
power points. If the character does not need to sleep for some reason,
he still must have 8 hours of restful calm before regaining power
points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent Manifesting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span>
If a psionic character has manifested powers recently, the drain on his
resources reduces his capacity to regain power points. When he regains
power points for the coming day, all power points he has used within
the last 8 hours count against his daily limit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Peaceful Environment:</span>
To regain power points, a psionic character must have enough peace,
quiet, and comfort to allow for proper concentration. The psionic
character&rsquo;s surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be
free from overt distractions, such as combat raging nearby or other
loud noises. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary
concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character
might incur while concentrating on regaining power points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Regaining Power Points:</span>
Once the character has rested in a suitable environment, it takes only
an act of concentration spanning 1 full round to regain all power
points of the psionic character&rsquo;s daily limit. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Death and Power Points:</span> If a character dies, all daily power points stored in his mind are wiped away. A potent effect (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">reality revision</span>) can recover the lost power points when it recovers the character.</p>
