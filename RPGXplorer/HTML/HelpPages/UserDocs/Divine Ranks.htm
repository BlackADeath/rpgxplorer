      <p>Each deity has a divine rank. A deity&rsquo;s divine rank determines how much power the entity has.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 0:</span> Creatures of
this rank are sometimes called quasi-deities or hero deities. Creatures
that have a mortal and a deity as parents also fall into this category.
These entities cannot grant spells, but are immortal and usually have
one or more ability scores that are far above the norm for their
species. They may have some worshipers. Ordinary mortals do not have a
divine rank of 0. They lack a divine rank altogether.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 1&ndash;5:</span> These
entities, called demigods, are the weakest of the deities. A demigod
can grant spells and perform a few deeds that are beyond mortal limits.
A demigod has anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand devoted
mortal worshipers and may receive veneration or respect from many more.
A demigod controls a small godly realm (usually on an Outer Plane) and
has minor control over a portfolio that includes one or more aspects of
mortal existence. A demigod might be very accomplished in a single
skill or a group of related skills, gain combat advantages in special
circumstances, or be able to bring about minor changes in reality
itself related to the portfolio.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 6&ndash;10:</span>
Called lesser deities, these entities grant spells and can perform more
powerful deeds than demigods can. Lesser deities have anywhere from a
few thousand to tens of thousands of worshipers and control larger
godly realms than demigods. They also have keener senses where their
portfolios are concerned.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 11&ndash;15: </span>These
entities are called intermediate deities. They have hundreds of
thousands of mortal worshipers and control larger godly realms than
demigods or lesser deities.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 16&ndash;20:</span>
Called greater deities, these entities may have millions of mortal
worshipers, and they command respect even among other deities. The most
powerful of greater deities rule over other deities just as mortal
sovereigns rule over commoners.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rank 21+:</span> These
entities are beyond the ken of mortals and care nothing for worshipers.
They do not grant spells, do not answer prayers, and do not respond to
queries. If they are known at all, it is to a handful of scholars on
the Material Plane. They are called overdeities. In some pantheistic
systems, the consent of an overdeity is required to become a god.25&nbsp;</p>
