      <p>The creator of a potion needs a level working surface and at
least a few containers in which to mix liquids, as well as a source of
heat to boil the brew. In addition, he needs ingredients. The costs for
materials and ingredients are subsumed in the cost for brewing the
potion - 25 gp x&nbsp; the level of the spell x&nbsp; the level of the
caster.</p>
      <p>All ingredients and materials used to brew a potion must be
fresh and unused. The character must pay the full cost for brewing each
potion. (Economies of scale do not apply.)</p>
      <p>The imbiber of the potion is both the caster and the target. Spells with a range of personal cannot be made into potions.</p>
      <p>The creator must have prepared the spell to be placed in the
potion (or must know the spell, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) and
must provide any material component or focus the spell requires.</p>
      <p>If casting the spell would reduce the caster&rsquo;s XP total,
he pays the XP cost upon beginning the brew in addition to the XP cost
for making the potion itself. Material components are consumed when he
begins working, but a focus is not. (A focus used in brewing a potion
can be reused.) The act of brewing triggers the prepared spell, making
it unavailable for casting until the character has rested and regained
spells. (That is, that spell slot is expended from his currently
prepared spells, just as if it had been cast.) Brewing a potion
requires one day.</p>
