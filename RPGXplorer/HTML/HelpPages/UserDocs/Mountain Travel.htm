      <p>High altitude can be extremely fatiguing-or sometimes
deadly-to creatures that aren&rsquo;t used to it. Cold becomes extreme,
and the lack of oxygen in the air can wear down even the most hardy of
warriors.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Acclimated Characters:</span>
Creatures accustomed to high altitude generally fare better than
lowlanders. Any creature with an Environment entry that includes
mountains is considered native to the area, and acclimated to the high
altitude. Characters can also acclimate themselves by living at high
altitude for a month. Characters who spend more than two months away
from the mountains must reacclimate themselves when they return.
Undead, constructs, and other creatures that do not breathe are immune
to altitude effects.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Altitude Zones:</span> In general, mountains present three possible altitude bands: low pass, low peak/high pass, and high peak.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Low Pass (lower than 5,000 feet):</span>
Most travel in low mountains takes place in low passes, a zone
consisting largely of alpine meadows and forests. Travelers may find
the going difficult (which is reflected in the movement modifiers for
traveling through mountains), but the altitude itself has no game
effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Low Peak or High Pass (5,000 to 15,000 feet):</span>
Ascending to the highest slopes of low mountains, or most normal travel
through high mountains, falls into this category. All nonacclimated
creatures labor to breathe in the thin air at this altitude. Characters
must succeed on a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, +1 per previous
check) or be fatigued. The fatigue ends when the character descends to
an altitude with more air. Acclimated characters do not have to attempt
the Fortitude save.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">High Peak (more than 15,000 feet):</span>
The highest mountains exceed 20,000 feet in height. At these
elevations, creatures are subject to both high altitude fatigue (as
described above) and altitude sickness, whether or not they&rsquo;re
acclimated to high altitudes. Altitude sickness represents long-term
oxygen deprivation, and it affects mental and physical ability scores.
After each 6-hour period a character spends at an altitude of over
15,000 feet, he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per
previous check) or take 1 point of damage to all ability scores.
Creatures acclimated to high altitude receive a +4 competence bonus on
their saving throws to resist high altitude effects and altitude
sickness, but eventually even seasoned mountaineers must abandon these
dangerous elevations.&nbsp;
