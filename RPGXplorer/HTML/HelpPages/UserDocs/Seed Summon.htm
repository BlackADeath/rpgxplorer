      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time:</span> 1 minute<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 75 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> One summoned creature<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 20 rounds (D)<br>

      <p>This seed can summon an outsider. It appears where the caster
designates and acts immediately, on his or her turn, if its spell
resistance is overcome and it fails a Will saving throw. It attacks the
caster&rsquo;s opponents to the best of its ability. If the caster can
communicate with the outsider, he or she can direct it not to attack,
to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. The spell
conjures an outsider the caster selects of CR 2 or less. For each +1 CR
of the summoned outsider, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. For each
additional outsider of the same Challenge Rating summoned, multiply the
Spellcraft DC by x2. When a caster develops a spell with the summon
seed that summons an air, chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or
water creature, the completed spell is also of that type. </p>

      
      <p>If the caster increases the Spellcraft DC by +10, he or she
can summon a creature of CR 2 or less from another monster type or
subtype. The summoned creature is assumed to have been plucked from
some other plane (or somewhere on the same plane). The summoned
creature attacks the caster&rsquo;s opponents to the best of its
ability; or, if the caster can communicate with it, it will perform
other actions. However, the summoning ends if the creature is asked to
perform a task inimical to its nature. For each +1 CR of the summoned
creature, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p>

      
      <p>Finally, by increasing the Spellcraft DC by +60, the caster
can summon a unique individual he or she specifies from anywhere in the
multiverse. The caster must know the target&rsquo;s name and some facts
about its life, defeat any magical protection against discovery or
other protection possessed by the target, and overcome the
target&rsquo;s spell resistance, and it must fail a Will saving throw.
The target is under no special compulsion to serve the caster. </p>
