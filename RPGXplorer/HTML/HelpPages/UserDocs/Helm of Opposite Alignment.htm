      <p>This metal hat looks like a typical helmet. When placed upon
the head, however, its curse immediately takes effect (Will DC 15
negates). On a failed save, the alignment of the wearer is radically
altered to an alignment as different as possible from the former
alignment - good to evil, chaotic to lawful, neutral to some extreme
commitment (LE, LG, CE, or CG). Alteration in alignment is mental as
well as moral, and the individual changed by the magic thoroughly
enjoys his new outlook. A character who succeeds on his save can
continue to wear the helmet without suffering the effect of the curse,
but if he takes it off and later puts it on again, another save is
required. The curse only works once; that is, a character whose
alignment has been changed cannot change it again by donning the helmet
a second time.</p>
      <p>Only a wish or a miracle can restore former alignment, and the
affected individual does not make any attempt to return to the former
alignment. (In fact, he views the prospect with horror and avoids it in
any way possible.) If a character of a class with an alignment
requirement is affected, an atonement spell is needed as well if the
curse is to be obliterated. When a helm of opposite alignment has
functioned once, it loses its magical properties.</p>
