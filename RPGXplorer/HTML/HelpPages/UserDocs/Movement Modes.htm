      <p>Creatures may have modes of movement other than walking and
running. These are natural, not magical, unless specifically noted in a
monster description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Burrow:</span> A creature
with a burrow speed can tunnel through dirt, but not through rock
unless the descriptive text says otherwise. Creatures cannot charge or
run while burrowing. Most burrowing creatures do not leave behind
tunnels other creatures can use (either because the material they
tunnel through fills in behind them or because they do not actually
dislocate any material when burrowing); see the individual creature
descriptions for details.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Climb:</span> A creature
with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The
creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC
of more than 0, but it always can choose to take 10 even if rushed or
threatened while climbing. The creature climbs at the given speed while
climbing. If it chooses an accelerated climb it moves at double the
given climb speed (or its base land speed, whichever is lower) and
makes a single Climb check at a &ndash;5 penalty. Creatures cannot run
while climbing. A creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class
(if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus on their
attacks against a climbing creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fly:</span> A creature with
a fly speed can move through the air at the indicated speed if carrying
no more than a light load. (Note that medium armor does not necessarily
constitute a medium load.) All fly speeds include a parenthetical note
indicating maneuverability, as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Perfect: The creature can perform almost any aerial
maneuver it wishes. It moves through the air as well as a human moves
over smooth ground.</li>
        <li>Good: The creature is very agile in the air (like a
housefly or a hummingbird), but cannot change direction as readily as
those with perfect maneuverability.</li>
        <li>Average: The creature can fly as adroitly as a small bird. </li>
        <li>Poor: The creature flies as well as a very large bird.</li>
        <li>Clumsy: The creature can barely maneuver at all.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A creature that flies can make dive attacks. A dive attack
works just like a charge, but the diving creature must move a minimum
of 30 feet and descend at least 10 feet. It can make only claw or talon
attacks, but these deal double damage. A creature can use the run
action while flying, provided it flies in a straight line.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Swim:</span> A creature with
a swim speed can move through water at its swim speed without making
Swim checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform some
special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always can choose to
take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered. The creature
can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight
line.&nbsp;
