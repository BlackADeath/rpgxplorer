				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Making an attack is a standard action.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Melee Attacks:</span> With a
normal melee weapon, you can strike any opponent within 5 feet.
(Opponents within 5 feet are considered adjacent to you.) Some melee
weapons have reach, as indicated in their descriptions. With a typical
reach weapon, you can strike opponents 10 feet away, but you
can&rsquo;t strike adjacent foes (those within 5 feet).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unarmed Attacks:</span> Striking for damage with punches, kicks, and head butts is much like attacking with a melee weapon, except for the following:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacks of Opportunity: </span>Attacking
unarmed provokes an attack of opportunity from the character you
attack, provided she is armed. The attack of opportunity comes before
your attack. An unarmed attack does not provoke attacks of opportunity
from other foes nor does it provoke an attack of opportunity from an
unarmed foe.<br>
      <br>
An unarmed character can&rsquo;t take attacks of opportunity (but see &ldquo;Armed&rdquo; Unarmed Attacks, below).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&ldquo;Armed&rdquo; Unarmed Attacks:</span>
Sometimes a character&rsquo;s or creature&rsquo;s unarmed attack counts
as an armed attack. A monk, a character with the Improved Unarmed
Strike feat, a spellcaster delivering a touch attack spell, and a
creature with natural physical weapons all count as being armed.<br>
      <br>
Note that being armed counts for both offense and defense (the character can make attacks of opportunity)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unarmed Strike Damage:</span> An
unarmed strike from a Medium character deals 1d3 points of damage (plus
your Strength modifier, as normal). A Small character&rsquo;s unarmed
strike deals 1d2 points of damage, while a Large character&rsquo;s
unarmed strike deals 1d4 points of damage. All damage from unarmed
strikes is nonlethal damage. Unarmed strikes count as light weapons
(for purposes of two-weapon attack penalties and so on).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dealing Lethal Damage:</span>
You can specify that your unarmed strike will deal lethal damage before
you make your attack roll, but you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your
attack roll. If you have the Improved Unarmed Strike feat, you can deal
lethal damage with an unarmed strike without taking a penalty on the
attack roll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ranged Attacks:</span> With a
ranged weapon, you can shoot or throw at any target that is within the
weapon&rsquo;s maximum range and in line of sight. The maximum range
for a thrown weapon is five range increments. For projectile weapons,
it is ten range increments. Some ranged weapons have shorter maximum
ranges, as specified in their descriptions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Attacks:</span> A
character who can make more than one attack per round must use the full
attack action (see Full-Round Actions, below) in order to get more than
one attack.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shooting or Throwing into a Melee:</span>
If you shoot or throw a ranged weapon at a target engaged in melee with
a friendly character, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on your attack roll.
Two characters are engaged in melee if they are enemies of each other
and either threatens the other. (An unconscious or otherwise
immobilized character is not considered engaged unless he is actually
being attacked.)<br>
      <br>
If your target (or the part of your target you&rsquo;re aiming at, if
it&rsquo;s a big target) is at least 10 feet away from the nearest
friendly character, you can avoid the &ndash;4 penalty, even if the
creature you&rsquo;re aiming at is engaged in melee with a friendly
character.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fighting Defensively as a Standard Action:</span>
You can choose to fight defensively when attacking. If you do so, you
take a &ndash;4 penalty on all attacks in a round to gain a +2 dodge
bonus to AC for the same round.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Critical Hits:</span> When you
make an attack roll and get a natural 20 (the d20 shows 20), you hit
regardless of your target&rsquo;s Armor Class, and you have scored a
threat. The hit might be a critical hit (or &ldquo;crit&rdquo;). To
find out if it&rsquo;s a critical hit, you immediately make a critical
roll&mdash;another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the
attack roll you just made. If the critical roll also results in a hit
against the target&rsquo;s AC, your original hit is a critical hit.
(The critical roll just needs to hit to give you a crit. It
doesn&rsquo;t need to come up 20 again.) If the critical roll is a
miss, then your hit is just a regular hit.<br>
      <br>
A critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once, with all
your usual bonuses, and add the rolls together. Unless otherwise
specified, the threat range for a critical hit on an attack roll is 20,
and the multiplier is x2.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span> Extra damage over and above a weapon&rsquo;s normal damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Increased Threat Range:</span>
Sometimes your threat range is greater than 20. That is, you can score
a threat on a lower number. In such cases, a roll of lower than 20 is
not an automatic hit. Any attack roll that doesn&rsquo;t result in a
hit is not a threat.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Increased Critical Multiplier: </span>Some weapons deal better than double damage on a critical hit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spells and Critical Hits: </span>A
spell that requires an attack roll can score a critical hit. A spell
attack that requires no attack roll cannot score a critical hit.<br>
