      <p>Four basic elements and two types of energy together make up
everything. The elements are earth, air, fire, and water. The types of
energy are positive and negative.<br>
The Material Plane reflects a balancing of those elements and energies;
all are found there. Each of the Inner Planes is dominated by one
element or type of energy. Other planes may show off various aspects of
these elemental traits. Many planes have no elemental or energy traits;
these traits are noted in a plane&rsquo;s description only when they
are present.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Air-Dominant:</span> Mostly
open space, planes with this trait have just a few bits of floating
stone or other elements. They usually have a breathable atmosphere,
though such a plane may include clouds of acidic or toxic gas.
Creatures of the earth subtype are uncomfortable on air-dominant planes
because they have little or no natural earth to connect with. They take
no actual damage, however.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Earth-Dominant:</span>
Planes with this trait are mostly solid. Travelers who arrive run the
risk of suffocation if they don&rsquo;t reach a cavern or other pocket
within the earth. Worse yet, individuals without the ability to burrow
are entombed in the earth and must dig their way out (5 feet per turn).
Creatures of the air subtype are uncomfortable on earth dominant planes
because these planes are tight and claustrophobic to them. But they
suffer no inconvenience beyond having difficulty moving.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fire-Dominant:</span> Planes
with this trait are composed of flames that continually burn without
consuming their fuel source. Fire-dominant planes are extremely hostile
to Material Plane creatures, and those without resistance or immunity
to fire are soon immolated.</p>
      <p>Unprotected wood, paper, cloth, and other flammable materials
catch fire almost immediately, and those wearing unprotected flammable
clothing catch on fire. In addition, individuals take 3d10 points of
fire damage every round they are on a fire-dominant plane. Creatures of
the water subtype are extremely uncomfortable on fire-dominant planes.
Those that are made of water take double damage each round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Water-Dominant:</span>
Planes with this trait are mostly liquid. Visitors who can&rsquo;t
breathe water or reach a pocket of air will likely drown. Creatures of
the fire subtype are extremely uncomfortable on water-dominant planes.
Those made of fire take 1d10 points of damage each round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Positive-Dominant: </span>An
abundance of life characterizes planes with this trait. The two kinds
of positive-dominant traits are minor positive-dominant and major
positive-dominant. A minor positive-dominant plane is a riotous
explosion of life in all its forms. Colors are brighter, fires are
hotter, noises are louder, and sensations are more intense as a result
of the positive energy swirling through the plane. All individuals in a
positive-dominant plane gain fast healing 2 as an extraordinary ability.</p>
      <p>Major positive-dominant planes go even further. A creature on
a major positive-dominant plane must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to
avoid being blinded for 10 rounds by the brilliance of the
surroundings. Simply being on the plane grants fast healing 5 as an
extraordinary ability. In addition, those at full hit points gain 5
additional temporary hit points per round. These temporary hit points
fade 1d20 rounds after the creature leaves the major positive- dominant
plane. However, a creature must make a DC 20 Fortitude save each round
that its temporary hit points exceed its normal hit point total.
Failing the saving throw results in the creature exploding in a riot of
energy, killing it.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Negative-Dominant: </span>Planes
with this trait are vast, empty reaches that suck the life out of
travelers who cross them. They tend to be lonely, haunted planes,
drained of color and filled with winds bearing the soft moans of those
who died within them. As with positive-dominant planes,
negative-dominant planes can be either minor or major. On minor
negative-dominant planes, living creatures take 1d6 points of damage
per round. At 0 hit points or lower, they crumble into ash.</p>
      <p>Major negative-dominant planes are even more severe. Each
round, those within must make a DC 25 Fortitude save or gain a negative
level. A creature whose negative levels equal its current levels or Hit
Dice is slain, becoming a wraith. The death ward spell protects a
traveler from the damage and energy drain of a negative-dominant plane.
