      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Spellcaster level 20th.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> The deity can
cast spells whose effective level is above 9th. The number of spells
per day the deity can cast of each spell level above 9th depends on the
deity&rsquo;s key ability score for spell-casting classes in which the
deity has achieved 20th level, as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting.
The numbers on that table represent one spell per day at each spell
level above 9th in which it receives bonus spells from its key ability
score, plus<br>
bonus spells based on the key ability score. The deity can use these
slots for spells prepared or cast with a metamagic feat, or for
lower-level spells.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If the deity has achieved 20th level in a spellcasting class
with fewer than nine levels of spells (such as bard, paladin, or
ranger), the deity can also cast one spell per day of each level
between the maximum normal spell level and 9th, plus appropriate bonus
spells of each level based on the deity&rsquo;s key ability score.
These spells are not shown on the table.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The deity also doesn&rsquo;t incur attacks of opportunity for casting spells when threatened.</p>
      <p>In addition, the deity receives the benefit of the Spell Focus feat on any spell it casts.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggested Portfolio Elements:</span> Magic.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Slots Above 9th Level:</span>
The Divine Spellcasting ability grants deities access to spell slots
above 9th level (which can be used to hold lower-level spells or spells
whose level has been increased above 9th by the use of metamagic
feats). The number of spell slots available to a deity depends on the
deity&rsquo;s key ability score (Intelligence for wizards, Wisdom for
clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers, and Charisma for bards and
sorcerers), as shown on Table: Divine Spellcasting.</p>
      <p>Even though the table only includes ability scores up to 61
and spell slots up to 25th level, the progression continues infinitely
in both directions. For ability scores beyond 61, or for spell slots
above 25th level, expand the table to follow the same patterns as shown.</p>
      <p>The numbers on this table include bonus spells that a deity
receives for having a sufficiently high ability score, as well as one
additional spell of each level at which the deity gains at least one
bonus spell. This additional spell is one of the benefits of the Divine
Spellcasting salient divine ability.&nbsp;</p>
