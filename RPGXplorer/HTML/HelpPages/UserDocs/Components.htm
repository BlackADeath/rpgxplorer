      <p>A spell&rsquo;s components are what you must do or possess to
cast it. The Components entry in a spell description includes
abbreviations that tell you what type of components it has. Specifics
for material, focus, and XP components are given at the end of the
descriptive text. Usually you don&rsquo;t worry about components, but
when you can&rsquo;t use a component for some reason or when a material
or focus component is expensive, then the components are important.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Verbal (V):</span> A verbal
component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you
must be able to speak in a strong voice. A silence spell or a gag
spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been
deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component
that he or she tries to cast.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Somatic (S): </span>A somatic
component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have
at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Material (M):</span> A
material component is one or more physical substances or objects that
are annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a
cost is given for a material component, the cost is negligible.
Don&rsquo;t bother to keep track of material components with negligible
cost. Assume you have all you need as long as you have your spell
component pouch.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Focus (F):</span> A focus
component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus
is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with
material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price
is given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your
spell component pouch.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Divine Focus (DF):</span> A
divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine
focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the
character&rsquo;s faith. <br>
If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the
spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation
before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component
(the abbreviation after the slash).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">XP Cost (XP):</span> Some
powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can
restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that
you lose a level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough
XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new
level, use those XP for casting a spell rather than keeping them and
advancing a level. The XP are treated just like a material component -
expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.
