      <p>Charging is a special full-round action that allows you to
move up to twice your speed and attack during the action. However, it
carries tight restrictions on how you can move.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Movement During a Charge:</span>
You must move before your attack, not after. You must move at least 10
feet (2 squares) and may move up to double your speed directly toward
the designated opponent.</p>
      <p>You must have a clear path toward the opponent, and nothing
can hinder your movement (such as difficult terrain or obstacles).
Here&rsquo;s what it means to have a clear path. First, you must move
to the closest space from which you can attack the opponent. (If this
space is occupied or otherwise blocked, you can&rsquo;t charge.)
Second, if any line from your starting space to the ending space passes
through a square that blocks movement, slows movement, or contains a
creature (even an ally), you can&rsquo;t charge. (Helpless creatures
don&rsquo;t stop a charge.)</p>
      <p>If you don&rsquo;t have line of sight to the opponent at the start of your turn, you can&rsquo;t charge that opponent.</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t take a 5-foot step in the same round as a charge.</p>
      <p>If you are able to take only a standard action or a move
action on your turn, you can still charge, but you are only allowed to
move up to your speed (instead of up to double your speed). You
can&rsquo;t use this option unless you are restricted to taking only a
standard action or move action on your turn.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacking on a Charge:</span>
After moving, you may make a single melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on
the attack roll. and take a &ndash;2 penalty to your AC until the start
of your next turn.</p>
      <p>A charging character gets a +2 bonus on the Strength check made to bull rush an opponent (see Bull Rush, above).</p>
      <p>Even if you have extra attacks, such as from having a high
enough base attack bonus or from using multiple weapons, you only get
to make one attack during a charge.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lances and Charge Attacks: </span>A lance deals double damage if employed by a mounted character in a charge.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapons Readied against a Charge:</span>
Spears, tridents, and certain other piercing weapons deal double damage
when readied (set) and used against a charging character.&nbsp;&nbsp;
