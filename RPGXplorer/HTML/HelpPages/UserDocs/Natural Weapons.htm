      <p>Natural weapons are weapons that are physically a part of a
creature. A creature making a melee attack with a natural weapon is
considered armed and does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Likewise,
it threatens any space it can reach. Creatures do not receive
additional attacks from a high base attack bonus when using natural
weapons. The number of attacks a creature can make with its natural
weapons depends on the type of the attack - generally, a creature can
make one bite attack, one attack per claw or tentacle, one gore attack,
one sting attack, or one slam attack (although Large creatures with
arms or arm-like limbs can make a slam attack with each arm). Refer to
the individual monster descriptions.</p>
      <p>Unless otherwise noted, a natural weapon threatens a critical hit on a natural attack roll of 20.</p>
      <p>When a creature has more than one natural weapon, one of them
(or sometimes a pair or set of them) is the primary weapon. All the
creature&rsquo;s remaining natural weapons are secondary.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The primary weapon is given in the creature&rsquo;s Attack
entry, and the primary weapon or weapons is given first in the
creature&rsquo;s Full Attack entry. A creature&rsquo;s primary natural
weapon is its most effective natural attack, usually by virtue of the
creature&rsquo;s physiology, training, or innate talent with the
weapon. An attack with a primary natural weapon uses the
creature&rsquo;s full attack bonus. Attacks with secondary natural
weapons are less effective and are made with a &ndash;5 penalty on the
attack roll, no matter how many there are. (Creatures with the
Multiattack feat take only a &ndash;2 penalty on secondary attacks.)
This penalty applies even when the creature makes a single attack with
the secondary weapon as part of the attack action or as an attack of
opportunity.</p>
      <p>Natural weapons have types just as other weapons do. The most common are summarized below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Bite:</span> The creature attacks with its mouth, dealing piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning damage.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Claw or Talon:</span> The creature rips with a sharp appendage, dealing piercing and slashing damage.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Gore:</span> The creature spears the opponent with an antler, horn, or similar appendage, dealing piercing damage.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Slap or Slam:</span> The creature batters opponents with an appendage, dealing bludgeoning damage.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Sting:</span> The creature
stabs with a stinger, dealing piercing damage. Sting attacks usually
deal damage from poison in addition to hit point damage.<br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Tentacle:</span> The creature flails at opponents with a powerful tentacle, dealing bludgeoning (and sometimes slashing) damage.&nbsp;
