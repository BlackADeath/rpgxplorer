				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Sometimes a combatant in a
melee lets her guard down. In this case, combatants near her can take
advantage of her lapse in defense to attack her for free. These free
attacks are called attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Threatened Squares:</span> You
threaten all squares into which you can make a melee attack, even when
it is not your action. Generally, that means everything in all squares
adjacent to your space (including diagonally). An enemy that takes
certain actions while in a threatened square provokes an attack of
opportunity from you. If you&rsquo;re unarmed, you don&rsquo;t normally
threaten any squares and thus can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reach Weapons:</span> Most
creatures of Medium or smaller size have a reach of only 5 feet. This
means that they can make melee attacks only against creatures up to 5
feet (1 square) away. However, Small and Medium creatures wielding
reach weapons threaten more squares than a typical creature. In
addition, most creatures larger than Medium have a natural reach of 10
feet or more.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Provoking an Attack of Opportunity:</span>
Two kinds of actions can provoke attacks of opportunity: moving out of
a threatened square and performing an action within a threatened square.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Moving:</span> Moving out of a
threatened square usually provokes an attack of opportunity from the
threatening opponent. There are two common methods of avoiding such an
attack&mdash;the 5-foot-step and the withdraw action (see below).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Performing a Distracting Act:</span>
Some actions, when performed in a threatened square, provoke attacks of
opportunity as you divert your attention from the battle. Table:
Actions in Combat notes many of the actions that provoke attacks of
opportunity.<br>
      <br>
Remember that even actions that normally provoke attacks of opportunity may have exceptions to this rule.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Making an Attack of Opportunity:</span>
An attack of opportunity is a single melee attack, and you can only
make one per round. You don&rsquo;t have to make an attack of
opportunity if you don&rsquo;t want to.<br>
      <br>
An experienced character gets additional regular melee attacks (by
using the full attack action), but at a lower attack bonus. You make
your attack of opportunity, however, at your normal attack
bonus&mdash;even if you&rsquo;ve already attacked in the round.<br>
      <br>
An attack of opportunity &ldquo;interrupts&rdquo; the normal flow of
actions in the round. If an attack of opportunity is provoked,
immediately resolve the attack of opportunity, then continue with the
next character&rsquo;s turn (or complete the current turn, if the
attack of opportunity was provoked in the midst of a character&rsquo;s
turn).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat Reflexes and Additional Attacks of Opportunity:</span>
If you have the Combat Reflexes feat you can add your Dexterity
modifier to the number of attacks of opportunity you can make in a
round. This feat does not let you make more than one attack for a given
opportunity, but if the same opponent provokes two attacks of
opportunity from you, you could make two separate attacks of
opportunity (since each one represents a different opportunity). Moving
out of more than one square threatened by the same opponent in the same
round doesn&rsquo;t count as more than one opportunity for that
opponent. All these attacks are at your full normal attack bonus.<br>
