					<P>Phase spiders and certain other creatures can exist on the Ethereal Plane.
					  While on the Ethereal Plane, a creature is called ethereal. Unlike incorporeal
				  creatures, ethereal creatures are not present on the Material Plane.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </P>
					<P>Ethereal creatures are invisible, inaudible, insubstantial,
					  and scentless to creatures on the Material Plane. Even
					    most magical attacks have no effect on them. See invisibility
					  and true seeing reveal ethereal
				  creatures.</P>
					<P>An ethereal creature can see and hear into the Material
					  Plane in a 60-foot radius, though material objects still
					  block sight and sound. (An ethereal creature can&#8217;t see through a
					  material wall, for instance.) An ethereal creature inside an object on
					  the Material Plane
					  cannot see. Things on the Material Plane, however, look
					  gray, indistinct, and ghostly. An ethereal creature can&#8217;t affect
					  the Material Plane, not even magically. An ethereal creature, however,
					  interacts with other
					  ethereal creatures and objects the way material creatures
					  interact with material creatures and objects.</P>
					<P>Even if a creature on the Material Plane can see an ethereal
					  creature the ethereal creature is on another plane. Only
					  force effects can affect the ethereal creatures. If, on
					  the other hand, both creatures
				  are ethereal, they can affect each other normally.</P>
					<P>A force effect originating on the Material Plane extends
					  onto the Ethereal Plane, so that a wall of force blocks
					  an ethereal creature, and a magic missile can strike one
					  (provided the spellcaster can see the
					  ethereal target). Gaze effects and abjurations also extend
					  from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane. None of
					  these effects extend from the Ethereal
				  Plane to the Material Plane.</P>
					<P>Ethereal creatures move in any direction (including up
					  or down) at will. They do not need to walk on the ground,
					  and material objects don&#8217;t block them (though they can&#8217;t see
					  while their eyes are within solid material).</P>
					<P>Ghosts have a power called manifestation that allows
					      them to appear on the Material Plane as incorporeal
					  creatures. Still, they are on the Ethereal Plane, and another ethereal
					    creature can interact
					    normally with a manifesting ghost. Ethereal creatures
					      pass through and operate in water as easily as air.
					  Ethereal
					    creatures do not fall or take
					    falling damage. <br>
