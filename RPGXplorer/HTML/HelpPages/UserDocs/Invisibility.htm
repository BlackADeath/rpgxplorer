      <p>The ability to move about unseen is not foolproof. While they can&rsquo;t
				  be seen, invisible creatures can be heard, smelled, or felt.</p>

					
      <p>Invisibility
				    makes a creature undetectable by vision, including darkvision.</p>
					
      <p>Invisibility does not, by itself, make a creature immune
					  to critical hits, but it does make the creature immune
				  to extra damage from being a ranger&rsquo;s favored enemy and from sneak
				  attacks.</p>

					
      <p>A creature can generally notice the presence of an active
					  invisible creature within 30 feet with a DC 20 Spot check.
					  The observer gains a hunch that &ldquo;something&rsquo;s there&rdquo; but
					  can&rsquo;t
					  see it or target it accurately with an attack. A creature
					  who is holding still is very hard to notice (DC 30). An inanimate object,
					  an unliving
					  creature holding still, or a completely immobile creature
					  is even harder to spot (DC 40). It&rsquo;s practically impossible (+20
					  DC) to pinpoint an invisible creature&rsquo;s location with a Spot check,
					  and even if a character succeeds on such a check, the invisible creature
					  still benefits
				  from total concealment (50% miss chance).</p>

					
      <p>A creature can use hearing to find an invisible creature.
					  A character can make a Listen check for this purpose as
					  a free action each round. A Listen check result at least
					  equal to the invisible creature&rsquo;s
					  Move Silently check result reveals its presence. (A creature
					  with no ranks in Move Silently makes a Move Silently check as a Dexterity
					  check to which
					  an armor check penalty applies.) A successful check lets
					  a character hear an invisible creature &ldquo;over there somewhere.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
					  practically impossible to pinpoint the location of an invisible creature.
					  A Listen
					  check that beats the DC by 20 pinpoints the invisible creature&rsquo;s
				  location.</p>

      <p>A creature can grope about to find an invisible
                      creature. A character can make a touch attack with his
                      hands or a
					  weapon into two adjacent 5-foot squares using a standard
					  action. If an invisible target
					  is in the designated area, there is a 50% miss chance on
					  the touch attack. If successful, the groping character
					  deals no damage but has successfully
					  pinpointed the invisible creature&rsquo;s current location. (If the invisible
					  creature moves, its location, obviously, is once again
				  unknown.)</p>

					
      <p>If an invisible creature strikes a character, the character
					  struck still knows the location of the creature that struck
					  him (until, of course, the invisible creature moves). The
					  only exception is if the
					  invisible creature has a reach greater than 5 feet. In
					  this case, the struck character knows the general location
					  of the creature but has not
				  pinpointed the exact location.</p>

					
      <p>If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose
					  location he has pinpointed, he attacks normally, but the
					  invisible creature still benefits from full concealment
					  (and thus a 50% miss chance). A particularly
					  large and slow creature might get a smaller miss chance.</p>
      <p>
					  If a character tries to attack an invisible creature whose
					  location he has not pinpointed, have the player choose
					  the space where the character will direct the attack. If
					  the invisible creature is there,
					  conduct the attack normally. If the enemy&rsquo;s not there, roll the
					  miss chance as if it were there, don&rsquo;t let the player see the result,
					  and tell him that the character has missed. That way the player doesn&rsquo;t
					  know whether the attack missed because the enemy&rsquo;s not there or
				  because you successfully rolled the miss chance.</p>

					
      <p>If an invisible character picks up a visible object, the
					  object remains visible. One could coat an invisible object
					  with flour to at least keep track of its position (until
					  the flour fell off or blew
					  away). An invisible creature can pick up a small visible
					  item and hide it on his person (tucked in a pocket or behind
					  a cloak) and render it
				  effectively invisible. </p>

					
      <p>Invisible creatures leave tracks. They can be tracked normally.
					  Footprints in sand, mud, or other soft surfaces can give
				  enemies clues to an invisible creature&rsquo;s location.</p>

					
      <p>An invisible creature in the water displaces water, revealing
					  its location. The invisible creature, however, is still
				  hard to see and benefits from concealment.</p>

					
      <p>A creature with the scent ability can detect an invisible
				  creature as it would a visible one.</p>

					
      <p>A creature with the Blind-Fight feat has a better chance
					  to hit an invisible creature. Roll the miss chance twice,
					  and he misses only if both rolls indicate a miss. (Alternatively,
					  make one 25% miss
				  chance roll rather than two 50% miss chance rolls.)</p>

					
      <p>A creature with blindsight can attack (and otherwise interact
				  with) creatures regardless of invisibility.</p>

					
      <p>An invisible burning torch still gives off light, as does
					  an invisible object with a light spell (or similar spell)
				  cast upon it.</p>

					
      <p>Ethereal creatures are invisible. Since ethereal creatures
					  are not materially present, Spot checks, Listen checks,
					  Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don&rsquo;t help locate them. Incorporeal
					  creatures are often invisible. Scent, Blind-Fight, and blindsight don&rsquo;t
					  help creatures find or attack invisible, incorporeal creatures, but Spot
					  checks and possibly
				  Listen checks can help.</p>

					
      <p>Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p>

					
      <p>Invisibility does not thwart detect spells.</p>

					
      <p>Since some creatures can detect or even see invisible
					        creatures, it is helpful to be able to hide even
					      when invisible.<br>
