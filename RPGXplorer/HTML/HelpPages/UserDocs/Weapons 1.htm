      <p>Although they generally follow the rules for magic weapons,
psionic weapons differ from mundane and magic weapons in their design.
Most possess some crystal components, and some are composed entirely of
crystal. Many also sport intricate traceries along the blade or haft,
which flicker now and then as if channeling flows of psychic energy.</p>
      <p>Psionic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to
+5. They apply these bonuses on both attack and damage rolls when used
in combat. This enhancement bonus is effective for the purpose of
overcoming creatures with damage resistance that is penetrated by
magic. All psionic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their
masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not stack with their enhancement
bonus on attack rolls.</p>
      <p>Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some
of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged
weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type
of attack. </p>
      <p>In addition to enhancement bonuses, psionic weapons can also
have the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special
ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
      <p>The rules for manifester level for weapons (called caster
level), additional damage dice, ranged weapons and ammunition,
ammunition and breakage, hardness and hit points, critical hits, and
weapons for unusually sized creatures for psionic weapons are the same
as for magic weapons. Psionic weapons do not have the chance to
generate light (though some may be mentally audible; see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mentally Audible:</span>
Fully 30% of psionic weapons telepathically mutter, croon, recite
battle poems, scream, or produce other mental &ldquo;noises&rdquo; when
first drawn, at first blood, or when they slay a significant enemy.
Such a weapon cannot be concealed from creatures within 15 feet when it
is drawn, nor can its mental &ldquo;soundtrack&rdquo; be curbed.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Usually a
character benefits from a psionic weapon in the same way a character
benefits from a mundane weapon - by attacking with it. If a weapon has
a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user
usually needs to project a command thought (a standard action).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psionic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions:</span>
Most psionic weapons have only enhancement bonuses. They can also have
the special abilities detailed here. A weapon with a special ability
must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.</p>
