      <p>A manifester creating a 4th-level, 5th-level, or 6th-level
astral construct can choose one special ability from this menu.
Alternatively, the construct can have two special abilities from Menu A.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Energy Touch (Ex):</span> If
you are a kineticist, the astral construct&rsquo;s physical attacks are
wreathed in your energy type, dealing an extra 1d6 points of energy
damage. If you are not a kineticist, the astral construct deals an
extra 1d4 points of damage of an energy type you choose (fire, cold,
acid, or electricity) when you manifest the construct.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Extra Attack:</span> If the
astral construct is Medium or smaller, it gains two slam attacks
instead of one when it makes a full attack. Its bonus on damage rolls
for each attack is equal to its Strength modifier, not its Strength
modifier x 1-1/2. If the astral construct is Large or larger, it gains
three slams instead of two when it makes a full attack. Its attacks are
otherwise unchanged. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Healing (Ex):</span> The astral construct heals 2 hit points each round. It is still immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Heavy Deflection (Ex):</span> The astral construct gains a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Buff (Ex):</span> The astral construct gains an extra 15 hit points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Critical (Ex):</span> The astral construct gains the Improved Critical feat with its slam attacks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Damage Reduction (Ex):</span>
The astral construct&rsquo;s surface forms a hard carapace and provides
an additional 3 points of damage reduction (or damage reduction 3/magic
if it does not already have damage reduction).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Fly (Ex):</span> The astral construct has physical wings and a fly speed of 40 feet (average).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Grab (Ex):</span> To
use this ability, the construct must hit with its slam attack. A
construct can use this ability only on a target that is at least one
size smaller than itself. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Swim: </span>The astral construct is streamlined and sharklike, and gains a swim speed of 60 feet.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Muscle (Ex):</span> The astral construct gains a +4 bonus to its Strength score.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Poison Touch (Ex):</span> If
the astral construct hits with a melee attack, the target must make an
initial Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral construct&rsquo;s HD +
astral construct&rsquo;s Cha modifier) or take 1 point of Constitution
damage. One minute later, the target must save again or take 1d2 points
of Constitution damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pounce (Ex):</span> If the astral construct charges a foe, it can make a full attack. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smite (Su):</span> Once per day the astral construct can make one attack that deals extra damage equal to its Hit Dice.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Trample (Ex):</span> As a
standard action during its turn each round, a Large or larger astral
construct can literally run over an opponent at least one size smaller
than itself. It merely has to move over the opponent to deal
bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + its Str modifier. The target can
attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral construct&rsquo;s Hit Dice +
astral construct&rsquo;s Str modifier) to negate the damage, or it can
instead choose to make an attack of opportunity at a &ndash;4 penalty.</p>
