      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Perform 40 ranks.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> When the
deity sings, plays a musical instrument, tells jokes, recites verse, or
engages in any other type of performance as a full-round action, the
deity has the option to create any of the following effects. The deity
can use this ability a number of times per day equal to its divine
rank. It affects up to one creature per divine rank within a burst with
a radius of 10 feet per divine rank, centered on the deity.</p>

      
      <ul>

        <li>Affected creatures become unable to take actions; instead,
they dance, observe the performance with rapt attention, laugh, or
applaud at the deity&rsquo;s option. The affected creatures also suffer
a &ndash;4 penalty to Armor Class, cannot succeed at Reflex saves
(except on a roll of 20), and cannot use shields. Creatures can resist
this mind effect with a successful Will save (DC 10 + the deity&rsquo;s
Charisma modifier + the deity&rsquo;s divine rank). The effects last
for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1 round per divine rank
thereafter.</li>

        <li>Affected creatures become blissfully calm. They are immune
to fear and compulsion effects except for those created by deities of
higher rank than the performing deity and any such effects already
operating on affected creatures are countered and dispelled. This
ability also counters and dispels rage effects except for those created
by deities of higher rank than the performing deity. Immunity to fear
and compulsion last for as long as the deity performs and for up to 1
round per divine rank thereafter.</li>

        <li>Affected creatures fall asleep. This works like the sleep
spell, except that any living creature can be affected. Creatures can
resist this mind effect with Will saves (DC 10 + the deity&rsquo;s
Charisma modifier + the deity&rsquo;s divine rank). Affected creatures
sleep for up to 1 hour per divine rank or until awakened. The deity can
end the effect at will.</li>

        <li>Affected creatures are so deeply moved that they simply
die. Only living creatures with Hit Dice equal to or less than the
deity&rsquo;s divine rank are affected. Creatures can resist the effect
with Fortitude saves (DC 10 + the deity&rsquo;s Charisma modifier + the
deity&rsquo;s divine rank).</li>

      
      </ul>

      
      <p>Once a creature makes a successful save against one of the
deity&rsquo;s performances, the creature cannot be affected again for
one day.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span> Not all deities with this ability can create all the mentioned effects, as specified in the deity descriptions.</p>
