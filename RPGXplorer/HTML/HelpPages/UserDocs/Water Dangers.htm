      <p>Any character can wade in relatively calm water that
isn&rsquo;t over his head, no check required. Similarly, swimming in
calm water only requires skill checks with a DC of 10. Trained swimmers
can just take 10. (Remember, however, that armor or heavy gear makes
any attempt at swimming much more difficult. See the Swim skill
description.)</p>

      
      <p>By contrast, fast-moving water is much more dangerous. On a
successful DC 15 Swim check or a DC 15 Strength check, it deals 1d3
points of nonlethal damage per round (1d6 points of lethal damage if
flowing over rocks and cascades). On a failed check, the character must
make another check that round to avoid going under.</p>

      
      <p>Very deep water is not only generally pitch black, posing a
navigational hazard, but worse, it deals water pressure damage of 1d6
points per minute for every 100 feet the character is below the
surface. A successful Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 for each previous
check) means the diver takes no damage in that minute. Very cold water
deals 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from hypothermia per minute of
exposure.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Drowning</p>
      <p>Any character can hold her breath for a number of rounds equal
to twice her Constitution score. After this period of time, the
character must make a DC 10 Constitution check every round in order to
continue holding her breath. Each round, the DC increases by 1.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When the character finally fails her Constitution check, she
begins to drown. In the first round, she falls unconscious (0 hp). In
the following round, she drops to -1 hit points and is dying. In the
third round, she drowns.</p>
      <p>It is possible to drown in substances other than water, such as sand, quicksand, fine dust, and silos full of grain.
