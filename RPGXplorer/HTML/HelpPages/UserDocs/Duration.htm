      <p>A power&rsquo;s Duration line tells you how long the psionic energy of the power lasts.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timed Durations:</span> Many
durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other
increment. When the time is up, the psionic energy sustaining the
effect fades, and the power ends. If a power&rsquo;s duration is
variable it is rolled secretly.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instantaneous:</span> The psionic energy comes and goes the instant the power is manifested, though the consequences might be long-lasting.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Permanent: </span>The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the power is vulnerable to dispel psionics.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentration:</span> The
power lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain
a power is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when
manifesting a power can also break your concentration while
you&rsquo;re maintaining one, causing the power to end. You can&rsquo;t
manifest a power while concentrating on another one. Some powers may
last for a short time after you cease concentrating. In such a case,
the power keeps going for the given length of time after you stop
concentrating, but no longer. Otherwise, you must concentrate to
maintain the power, but you can&rsquo;t maintain it for more than a
stated duration in any event. If a target moves out of range, the power
reacts as if your concentration had been broken.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</span>
If the power affects creatures directly the result travels with the
subjects for the power&rsquo;s duration. If the power creates an
effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or
remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its
duration ends. If the power affects an area then the power stays with
that area for its duration. Creatures become subject to the power when
they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch Powers and Holding the Charge:</span>
In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t discharge a touch power on the round
you manifest it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the
power) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. If
you touch anything with your hand while holding a charge, the power
discharges. If you manifest another power, the touch power dissipates.</p>
      <p>Some touch powers allow you to touch multiple targets as part
of the power. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a power; you must
touch all the targets of the power in the same round that you finish
manifesting the power. You can touch one friend (or yourself) as a
standard action or as many as six friends as a full round action.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge:</span> Occasionally a power lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(D) Dismissible:</span> If
the Duration line ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss the
power at will. You must be within range of the power&rsquo;s effect and
must mentally will the dismissal, which causes the same display as when
you first manifested the power. Dismissing a power is a standard action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A power that depends on
concentration is dismissible by its very nature, and dismissing it does
not take an action or cause a display, since all you have to do to end
the power is to stop concentrating on your turn.</p>
