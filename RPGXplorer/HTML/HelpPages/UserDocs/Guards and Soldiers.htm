      <p>&nbsp;A city typically has full-time military personnel equal
to 1% of its adult population, in addition to militia or conscript
soldiers equal to 5% of the population. The full-time soldiers are city
guards responsible for maintaining order within the city, similar to
the role of modern police, and (to a lesser extent) for defending the
city from outside assault. Conscript soldiers are called up to serve in
case of an attack on the city.</p>
      <p>A typical city guard force works on three eight-hour shifts,
with 30% of the force on a day shift (8 A.M. to 4 P.M.), 35% on an
evening shift (4 P.M. to 12 A.M.), and 35% on a night shift (12 A.M. to
8 A.M.). At any given time, 80% of the guards on duty are on the
streets patrolling, while the remaining 20% are stationed at various
posts throughout the city, where they can respond to nearby alarms. At
least one such guard post is present within each neighborhood of a city
(each neighborhood consisting of several districts).</p>
      <p>The majority of a city guard force is made up of warriors,
mostly 1st level. Officers include higher-level warriors, fighters, a
fair number of clerics, and wizards or sorcerers, as well as multiclass
fighter/spellcasters.&nbsp;</p>
