      <p>When a power is manifested, a display may accompany the
primary effect. This secondary effect may be auditory, material,
mental, olfactory, or visual. No power&rsquo;s display is significant
enough to create consequences for the psionic creatures, allies, or
opponents during combat. The secondary effect for a power occurs only
if the power&rsquo;s description indicates it. If multiple powers with
similar displays are in effect simultaneously, the displays do not
necessary become more intense. Instead, the overall display remains
much the same, though with minute spikes in intensity. A Psicraft check
(DC 10 + 1 per additional power in use) reveals the exact number of
simultaneous powers in play.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Dispense with Displays:</span>
Despite the fact that almost every power has a display, a psionic
character can always choose to manifest the power without the flashy
accompaniment. To manifest a power without any display (no matter how
many displays it might have), a manifester must make a Concentration
check (DC 15 + the level of the power). This check is part of the
action of manifesting the power. If the check is unsuccessful, the
power manifests normally with its display.</p>
      <p>Even if a manifester manifests a power without a display, he
is still subject to attacks of opportunity in appropriate
circumstances. (Of course, another Concentration check can be made as
normal to either manifest defensively or maintain the power if
attacked.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Auditory:</span> A
bass-pitched hum issues from the manifester&rsquo;s vicinity or in the
vicinity of the power&rsquo;s subject (manifester&rsquo;s choice),
eerily akin to many deep-pitched voices. The sound grows in a second
from hardly noticeable to as loud as a shout strident enough to be
heard within 100 feet. At the manifester&rsquo;s option, the
instantaneous sound can be so soft that it can be heard only within 15
feet with a successful DC 10 Listen check. Some powers describe unique
auditory displays.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Material:</span> The subject
or the area is briefly slicked with a translucent, shimmering
substance. The glistening substance evaporates after 1 round regardless
of the power&rsquo;s duration. Sophisticated psions recognize the
material as ectoplasmic seepage from the Astral Plane; this substance
is completely inert.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mental:</span> A subtle chime
rings once in the minds of creatures within 15 feet of either the
manifester or the subject (at the manifester&rsquo;s option). At the
manifester&rsquo;s option, the chime can ring continuously for the
power&rsquo;s duration. Some powers describe unique mental displays. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Olfactory:</span> An odd but
familiar odor brings to mind a brief mental flash of a long-buried
memory. The scent is difficult to pin down, and no two individuals ever
describe it the same way. The odor originates from the manifester and
spreads to a distance of 20 feet, then fades in less than a second (or
lasts for the duration, at the manifester&rsquo;s option).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Visual:</span> The
manifester&rsquo;s eyes burn like points of silver fire while the power
remains in effect. A rainbow-flash of light sweeps away from the
manifester to a distance of 5 feet and then dissipates, unless a unique
visual display is described. This is the case when the Display entry
includes &ldquo;see text,&rdquo; which means that a visual effect is
described somewhere in the text of the power. </p>
