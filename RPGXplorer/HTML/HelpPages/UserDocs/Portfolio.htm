      <p>Every deity of rank 1 or higher has at least limited knowledge
and control over some aspect of mortal existence. A deity&rsquo;s
connection to its portfolio gives it a number of powers.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Portfolio Sense:</span>
Demigods have a limited ability to sense events involving their
portfolios. They automatically sense any event that involves one
thousand or more people. The ability is limited to the present. Lesser
deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios
and affects five hundred or more people. Intermediate deities
automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios,
regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses
extend one week into the past for every divine rank they have. Greater
deities automatically sense any event that involves their portfolios,
regardless of the number of people involved. In addition, their senses
extend one week into the past and one week into the future for every
divine rank they have. When a deity senses an event, it merely knows
that the event is occurring and where it is. The deity receives no
sensory information about the event. Once a deity notices an event, it
can use its remote sensing power to perceive the event.&nbsp;</p>
