      <p><strong></strong>You are particularly good at focusing your mind. </p>
      <p>The following are additional uses for the concentration skill.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check:</span> You must make a
Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by
taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some
action that requires your full attention. Such actions include
manifesting a power, concentrating on an active power, directing a
power, or using a psi-like ability.</p>
      <p>If the Concentration check succeeds, you can continue with the
action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails
and is wasted. If you were in the process of manifesting a power, the
power points are lost. If you were concentrating on an active power,
the power ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were
directing a power, the direction fails but the power remains active. If
you were using a psi-like ability, that use of the ability is lost.</p>
      <p>The table below summarizes various types of distractions that
cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs
while you are trying to manifest a power, you must add the level of the
power you are trying to manifest to the appropriate Concentration DC.</p>

      <p><span class="HelpTableNotes">1 - If you are trying to
manifest, concentrate on, or direct a power when the distraction
occurs, add the level of the power to the indicated
DC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br class="HelpTableNotes">
      <span class="HelpTableNotes">2 - Such as during the manifestation
of a power with a manifesting time of 1 round or more. Also from an
attack of opportunity or readied attack made in response to the power
being manifested (for powers with a manifesting time of 1 action) or
the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a
full-round action).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br class="HelpTableNotes">
      <span class="HelpTableNotes">3 - Such as from standing in natural fire or lava.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br class="HelpTableNotes">
      <span class="HelpTableNotes">4 - If the power allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gain Psionic Focus:</span>
Merely holding a reservoir of psionic power points in mind gives
psionic characters a special energy. Psionic characters can put that
energy to work without actually paying a power point cost - they can
become psionically focused as a special use of the Concentration skill.</p>
      <p>If you have 1 or more power points available, you can meditate
to attempt to become psionically focused. The DC to become psionically
focused is 20. Meditating is a full-round action that provokes attacks
of opportunity. When you are psionically focused, you can expend your
focus on any single Concentration check you make thereafter. When you
expend your focus in this manner, your Concentration check is treated
as if you rolled a 15. It&rsquo;s like taking 10, except that the
number you add to your Concentration modifier is 15. You can also
expend your focus to gain the benefit of a psionic feat - many psionic
feats are activated in this way.</p>
      <p>Once you are psionically focused, you remain focused until you
expend your focus, become unconscious, or go to sleep (or enter a
meditative trance, in the case of elans), or until your power point
reserve drops to 0.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Action:</span> Usually none.
In most cases, making a Concentration check doesn&rsquo;t require an
action; it is either a free action (when attempted reactively) or part
of another action (when attempted actively). Meditating to gain psionic
focus is a full-round action.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try Again:</span> Yes, though
a success doesn&rsquo;t cancel the effects of a previous failure, such
as the loss of the power points for a power being manifested or the
disruption of a power being concentrated on.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> You can use
Concentration to manifest a power or use a psi-like ability
defensively, so as to avoid attacks of opportunity altogether. The DC
of the check is 15 + the power&rsquo;s level. If the Concentration
check succeeds, you can manifest normally without provoking any attacks
of opportunity. If the Concentration check fails, the power also
automatically fails and the power points are wasted, just as if your
concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.</p>
      <p>A character with the Combat Manifestation feat gets a +4 bonus
on Concentration checks made to manifest a power or use a psi-like
ability while on the defensive or while grappling or pinned.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synergy: </span>If you have 5 or more ranks in Concentration, you get a +2 bonus on Autohypnosis checks.</p>
