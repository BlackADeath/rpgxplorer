      <p>When
you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can
normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard
action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill
being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In
other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough
times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your
result as if you had rolled a 20.<br>




      <br>




Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes
that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty
times as long as making a single check would take.<br>




      <br>




Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before
succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries
penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those
penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common "take 20"
skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.<br>




      <br>




Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks: The normal take 10 and take 20
rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level
checks.
