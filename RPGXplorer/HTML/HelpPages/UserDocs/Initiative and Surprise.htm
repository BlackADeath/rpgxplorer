				<td class="HelpText" valign="top"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initiative Checks:</span>
At the start of a battle, each combatant makes an initiative check. An
initiative check is a Dexterity check. Each character applies his or
her Dexterity modifier to the roll. Characters act in order, counting
down from highest result to lowest. In every round that follows, the
characters act in the same order (unless a character takes an action
that results in his or her initiative changing; see Special Initiative
Actions).<br>
      <br>
If two or more combatants have the same initiative check result, the
combatants who are tied act in order of total initiative modifier
(highest first). If there is still a tie, the tied characters should
roll again to determine which one of them goes before the other.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Flat-Footed:</span> At the start
of a battle, before you have had a chance to act (specifically, before
your first regular turn in the initiative order), you are flat-footed.
You can&rsquo;t use your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) while
flat-footed. Barbarians and rogues have the uncanny dodge extraordinary
ability, which allows them to avoid losing their Dexterity bonus to AC
due to being flat-footed.<br>
      <br>
A flat-footed character can&rsquo;t make attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inaction:</span> Even if you can&rsquo;t take actions, you retain your initiative score for the duration of the encounter.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SURPRISE</span><br>
When a combat starts, if you are not aware of your opponents and they are aware of you, you&rsquo;re surprised.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Determining Awareness:</span>Sometimes
all the combatants on a side are aware of their opponents, sometimes
none are, and sometimes only some of them are. Sometimes a few
combatants on each side are aware and the other combatants on each side
are unaware.<br>
      <br>
Determining awareness may call for Listen checks, Spot checks, or other checks.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Surprise Round:</span> If
some but not all of the combatants are aware of their opponents, a
surprise round happens before regular rounds begin. Any combatants
aware of the opponents can act in the surprise round, so they roll for
initiative. In initiative order (highest to lowest), combatants who
started the battle aware of their opponents each take a standard action
during the surprise round. You can also take free actions during the
surprise round. If no one or everyone is surprised, no surprise round
occurs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Unaware Combatants:</span>
Combatants who are unaware at the start of battle don&rsquo;t get to
act in the surprise round. Unaware combatants are flat-footed because
they have not acted yet, so they lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.<br>
