      <p>Some horrible creatures, especially undead monsters, possess a
fearsome supernatural ability to drain levels from those they strike in
combat. The creature making an energy drain attack draws a portion of
its victim&rsquo;s life force from her. Most energy drain attacks
require a successful melee attack roll&mdash;mere physical contact is
not enough. Each successful energy drain attack bestows one or more
negative levels on the opponent. A creature takes the following
penalties for each negative level it has gained. </p>

					
      <ul>

					  <li>-1 on all skill checks and ability checks.</li>

					  <li>-1 on attack rolls and saving throws.</li>

					  <li>-5 hit points.</li>

					  <li>-1 effective level (whenever the creature&rsquo;s level
	                      is used in a die roll or calculation, reduce it by one
	                      for each negative level). </li>

				  
      </ul>
					
      <p>If the victim casts spells, she loses access to
					            one spell as if she had cast her highest-level,
					      currently available spell. (If she has more than one spell
					            at her highest level, she chooses which she loses.)
					            In addition, when she next prepares spells or
					      regains spell slots, she gets one less spell slot at her highest
					            spell level. </p>

					
      <p>Negative levels remain for 24 hours or until removed with a
spell, such as restoration. After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must
attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 attacker&rsquo;s HD +
attacker&rsquo;s Cha modifier). (The DC is provided in the
attacker&rsquo;s description.) If the saving throw succeeds, the
negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. The afflicted
creature makes a separate saving throw for each negative level it has
gained. If the save fails, the negative level goes away, but the
creature &rsquo;s level is also reduced by one.</p>

					
      <p>A character with negative levels at least equal to her
					      current level, or drained below 1st level, is instantly
					      slain. Depending on the creature that killed her, she
					      may rise the next night as a monster
					      of that kind. If not, she rises as a wight. A creature
					      gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level
					      it bestows (though not if the negative
					      level is caused by a spell or similar effect).<br>
