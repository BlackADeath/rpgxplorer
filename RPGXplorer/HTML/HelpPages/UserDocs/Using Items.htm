      <p>To use a psionic item, it must be activated, although
sometimes activation is accomplished simply by picking up an item or
putting it on. Some items, once they are carried or worn, function
constantly. In most cases, using an item requires a standard action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. By contrast, power
completion items (see below) are treated just like powers in combat and
do provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p>Activating a psionic item is a standard action unless the item
description indicates otherwise. The manifesting time of a power is the
time required to activate the same power in an item, whether it&rsquo;s
a power stone, a dorje, or a psionic tattoo, unless the item
description specifically states otherwise.</p>
      <p>The four ways to activate psionic items are described below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Completion:</span> This
is the activation method for power stones. A power stone holds a power
that is mostly finished. All that&rsquo;s left to do is perform the
short, simple, finishing parts of the manifestation (the final mental
coda, as it were). To use a power completion item safely, a character
must be of high enough level in the appropriate class to manifest the
power already. If he can&rsquo;t already manifest the power,
there&rsquo;s a chance he&rsquo;ll make a mistake (see Brainburn in the
power stone description). Activating a power completion item is a
standard action and provokes attacks of opportunity exactly as
manifesting a power does.</p>
      <p>Powers stored in power completion items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum necessary to manifest the stored power. However, an
item&rsquo;s description may specify otherwise (some power stones have
manifester levels higher than the minimum required to manifest the
stored power, and are then assumed to be augmented as well).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Trigger:</span> This is
the activation method for dorjes and psicrowns. It requires the special
knowledge of power manifestation that a character of the appropriate
class would know, and the formation of the appropriate command thought.
If a power is on a character&rsquo;s power list, the character knows
how to use a power trigger item that stores that power. The user must
still determine what power is stored in the item before she can
activate it. Activating a power trigger item is a standard action that
does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p>Powers stored in power trigger items are not augmented. Such
powers are assumed to be stored in the item at the minimum manifester
level necessary to manifest the power. However, certain items may
specify a higher manifester level than necessary. If such an item holds
a power that deals hit point damage, the power is assumed to be
augmented to the maximum allowed by the power and the manifester level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Command Thought:</span> If no
activation method is suggested either in the psionic item description
or by the nature of the item, assume that a command thought is needed
to activate it. Command thought activation means that a character
mentally projects a thought, and the item activates. No other special
knowledge is needed. Activating a command thought psionic item is a
standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p>
      <p>Sometimes the command thought to activate an item is mentally
imprinted within it and is whispered into the mind of a creature who
picks it up. Other items are silent, but a Knowledge (psionics) or
Knowledge (history) check might be useful in helping to identify
command thoughts. A successful DC 30 check is needed to come up with
the command thought in this case. The power <span style="font-style: italic;">psionic identify</span> reveals command thoughts.</p>
      <p>Powers stored in command thought items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Use-Activated: </span>This type of psionic item simply has to be used to activate. Use activation is generally straightforward and self-explanatory.</p>
      <p>Many use-activated items are objects that a character wears.
Some items made for wearing must still be activated. Although this
activation sometimes requires a command thought (see above), usually it
means mentally willing the activation to happen&nbsp; (a free action).
The description of an item states whether a command thought is needed
in such a case.</p>
      <p>Unless stated otherwise, activating a use-activated psionic
item is either a standard action or not an action at all and does not
provoke attacks of opportunity, unless the use involves performing an
action that provokes attacks of opportunity in itself. If the use of
the item takes time before a psionic effect occurs, then use activation
is a standard action. If the item&rsquo;s activation is subsumed in its
use and takes no extra time, use activation is not an action at all.</p>
      <p>Use activation doesn&rsquo;t mean that if you use an item, you
automatically know what it can do. You must know (or at least guess)
what the item can do and then use the item to activate it, unless the
benefit of the item comes automatically.</p>
      <p>Powers stored in use-activated items are usually not
augmented, because the manifester level of such an item is assumed to
be the minimum possible to manifest the stored power.</p>
