      <p>This is an extraordinary ability.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Divine rank 6, Alter Size salient divine ability, Alter Form salient divine ability.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> The deity can
assume the form of another creature. The forms a deity can assume are
limited and vary with each deity. The forms allowed are listed in the
deity&rsquo;s description. The deity can remain in the assumed form
indefinitely, but it resumes its own form if slain.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes:</span> The deity
acquires the physical, natural, and extraordinary abilities of the form
it has assumed (but not spell-like or supernatural abilities) while
retaining its own mind. Physical abilities include natural size and
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include
armor, natural weapons (such as claws, bite, swoop and rake, and
constriction; but not petrification, breath weapons, energy drain,
energy effect, and the like), and similar gross physical qualities
(presence or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so on). A
body with extra limbs does not allow the deity to make more attacks (or
more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than normal. Natural abilities
also include mundane movement capabilities, such as walking, swimming,
and flight with wings. The deity&rsquo;s speed is that of the assumed
form or the deity&rsquo;s normal speed, whichever is higher.</p>
      <p>In general, any part of the body or piece of equipment that is
separated from the whole reverts to its original form. However, if the
assumed form has an extraordinary ability that allows it to produce a
substance or shed part of its body, then this ability also grants that
ability.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The deity retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma
scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its
Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, and base saves. (New
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores may affect final attack
and save bonuses.) The deity retains its outsider type, extraordinary
abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its supernatural
abilities.</p>
      <p>The deity also retains its divine Armor Class bonus and divine qualities and abilities, provided they are not supernatural.</p>
      <p>The deity can cast spells for which it has components. It
needs a voice like that of a humanoid for verbal components and hands
like those of a humanoid for somatic components, Likewise, the deity
needs hands to use many of its powers, such as creating objects related
to its portfolio.</p>
      <p>When the shape shift occurs, the deity&rsquo;s equipment, if
any, transforms to match the new form. If the new form is a creature
that does not use equipment (aberration, animal, beast, magical beast,
construct, dragon, elemental, ooze, some outsiders, plant, some undead
creatures, some shapechangers, or vermin), the equipment melds into the
new form and becomes nonfunctional.</p>
      <p>Material components and focuses melded in this way cannot be
used to cast spells. If the new form uses equipment (fey, giant,
humanoid, some outsiders, many shapechangers, many undead creatures),
the deity&rsquo;s equipment changes to match the new form and retains
its properties.</p>
      <p>This ability cannot confer class levels or class abilities.</p>
      <p>The deity can change physical qualities such as hair color,
hair texture, skin color, and gender. The deity can use this ability to
create disguises, gaining a bonus of +15 on its Disguise checks.</p>
      <p>The deity can use its Alter Size ability simultaneously with
this one to become as small as a grain of sand or as large as 1,600
feet in the assumed form&rsquo;s greatest dimension.</p>
