      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target:</span> You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures weighing up to 1,000 lb.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> Instantaneous, or 5 rounds for temporal transport<br>

      <p>Spells using the transport seed instantly take the caster to a
designated destination, regardless of distance. For interplanar travel,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. For each additional 50 pounds in
objects and willing creatures beyond the base 1,000 pounds, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +2. The base use of the transport seed provides
instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. To shift the
transportation medium to another medium increase the Spellcraft DC by
+2. The caster does not need to make a saving throw, nor is spell
resistance applicable to him or her. Only objects worn or carried
(attended) by another person receive saving throws and spell
resistance. For a spell intended to transport unwilling creatures,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. The caster must have at least a
reliable description of the place to which he or she is transporting.
If the caster attempts to use the transport seed with insufficient or
misleading information, the character disappears and simply reappear in
his or her original location. </p>

      
      <p>As a special use of the transport seed, a caster can develop a
spell that temporarily transports him or her into a different time
stream (leaving the caster in the same physical location); this
increases the Spellcraft DC by +8. If the caster moves him or herself,
or the subject, into a slower time stream for 5 rounds, time ceases to
flow for the subject, and its condition becomes fixed - no force or
effect can harm it until the duration expires. If the caster moves him
or her self into a faster time stream, the caster speeds up so greatly
that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still
moving at their normal speeds. The caster is free to act for 5 rounds
of apparent time. Fire, cold, poison gas, and similar effects can still
harm the caster. While the caster is in the fast time stream, other
creatures are invulnerable to his or her attacks and spells; however,
the caster can create spell effects and leave them to take effect when
he or she reenters normal time. Because of the branching nature of
time, epic spells used to transport a subject into a faster time stream
cannot be made permanent, nor can the duration of 5 rounds be extended.
More simply, the seed can haste or slow a subject for 20 rounds by
transporting it to the appropriate time stream. This decreases the
Spellcraft DC by &ndash;4. </p>
