      <p>On the next turn after a character is reduced to between
&ndash;1 and &ndash;9 hit points and on all subsequent turns, roll d%
to see whether the dying character becomes stable. He has a 10% chance
of becoming stable. If he doesn&rsquo;t, he loses 1 hit point. (A
character who&rsquo;s unconscious or dying can&rsquo;t use any special
action that changes the initiative count on which his action occurs.)</p>
      <p>If the character&rsquo;s hit points drop to &ndash;10 or lower, he&rsquo;s dead.</p>
      <p>You can keep a dying character from losing any more hit points and make him stable with a DC 15 Heal check.</p>
      <p>If any sort of healing cures the dying character of even 1 point of damage, he stops losing hit points and becomes stable.</p>
      <p>Healing that raises the dying character&rsquo;s hit points to
0 makes him conscious and disabled. Healing that raises his hit points
to 1 or more makes him fully functional again, just as if he&rsquo;d
never been reduced to 0 or lower. A spellcaster retains the
spellcasting capability she had before dropping below 0 hit points.</p>
      <p>A stable character who has been tended by a healer or who has
been magically healed eventually regains consciousness and recovers hit
points naturally. If the character has no one to tend him, however, his
life is still in danger, and he may yet slip away.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering with Help:</span>
One hour after a tended, dying character becomes stable, roll d%. He
has a 10% chance of becoming conscious, at which point he is disabled
(as if he had 0 hit points). If he remains unconscious, he has the same
chance to revive and become disabled every hour. Even if unconscious,
he recovers hit points naturally. He is back to normal when his hit
points rise to 1 or higher.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recovering without Help:</span> A severely wounded character left alone usually dies. He has a small chance, however, of recovering on his own.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A character who becomes stable on his own (by making the 10%
roll while dying) and who has no one to tend to him still loses hit
points, just at a slower rate. He has a 10% chance each hour of
becoming conscious. Each time he misses his hourly roll to become
conscious, he loses 1 hit point. He also does not recover hit points
through natural healing.</p>
      <p>Even once he becomes conscious and is disabled, an unaided
character still does not recover hit points naturally. Instead, each
day he has a 10% chance to start recovering hit points naturally
(starting with that day); otherwise, he loses 1 hit point.</p>
      <p>Once an unaided character starts recovering hit points
naturally, he is no longer in danger of naturally losing hit points
(even if his current hit point total is negative).&nbsp;</p>
