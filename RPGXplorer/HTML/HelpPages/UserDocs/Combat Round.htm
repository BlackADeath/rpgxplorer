				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Each round represents 6 seconds
in the game world. A round presents an opportunity for each character
involved in a combat situation to take an action. <br>
      <br>
Each round&rsquo;s activity begins with the character with the highest
initiative result and then proceeds, in order, from there. Each round
of a combat uses the same initiative order. When a character&rsquo;s
turn comes up in the initiative sequence, that character performs his
entire round&rsquo;s worth of actions. (For exceptions, see Attacks of
Opportunity and Special Initiative Actions.)<br>
      <br>
For almost all purposes, there is no relevance to the end of a round or
the beginning of a round. A round can be a segment of game time
starting with the first character to act and ending with the last, but
it usually means a span of time from one round to the same initiative
count in the next round. Effects that last a certain number of rounds
end just before the same initiative count that they began on.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Actions: </span>In a normal
round, you can perform a standard action and a move action, or you can
perform a full-round action. You can also perform one or more free
actions. You can always take a move action in place of a standard
action.<br>
      <br>
In some situations (such as in a surprise round), you may be limited to taking only a single move action or standard action.</td>
