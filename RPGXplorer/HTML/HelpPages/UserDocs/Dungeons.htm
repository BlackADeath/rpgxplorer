      <p>The four basic dungeon types are defined by their current
status. Many dungeons are variations on these basic types or
combinations of more than one of them. Sometimes old dungeons are used
again and again by different inhabitants for different purposes.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ruined Structure:</span> Once
occupied, this place is now abandoned (completely or in part) by its
original creator or creators, and other creatures have wandered in.
Many subterranean creatures look for abandoned underground
constructions in which to make their lairs. Any traps that might exist
have probably been set off, but wandering beasts might very well be
common.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Occupied Structure:</span>
This type of dungeon is still in use. Creatures (usually intelligent)
live there, although they may not be the dungeon&rsquo;s creators. An
occupied structure might be a home, a fortress, a temple, an active
mine, a prison, or a headquarters. This type of dungeon is less likely
to have traps or wandering beasts, and more likely to have organized
guards-both on watch and on patrol. Traps or wandering beasts that
might be encountered are usually under the control of the occupants.
Occupied structures have furnishings to suit the inhabitants, as well
as decorations, supplies, and the ability for occupants to move around
(doors they can open, hallways large enough for them to pass through,
and so on). The inhabitants might have a communication system, and they
almost certainly control an access to the outside.</p>

      
      <p>Some dungeons are partially occupied and partially empty or in
ruins. In such cases, the occupants are typically not the original
builders but instead a group of intelligent creatures that have set up
their base, lair, or fortification within an abandoned dungeon.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Safe Storage:</span> When
people want to protect something, they might bury it underground.
Whether the item they want to protect is a fabulous treasure, a
forbidden artifact, or the dead body of an important figure, these
valuable objects are placed within a dungeon and surrounded by
barriers, traps, and guardians.</p>

      
      <p>The safe storage type of dungeon is the most likely to have
traps but the least likely to have wandering beasts. This type of
dungeon normally is built for function rather than appearance, but
sometimes it has ornamentation in the form of statuary or painted
walls. This is particularly true of the tombs of important people.</p>

      
      <p>Sometimes, however, a vault or a crypt is constructed in such
a way as to house living guardians. The problem with this strategy is
that something must be done to keep the creatures alive between
intrusion attempts. Magic is usually the best solution to provide food
and water for these creatures. Even if there&rsquo;s no way anything
living can survive in a safe storage dungeon, certain monsters can
still serve as guardians. Builders of vaults or tombs often place
undead creatures or constructs, both of which which have no need for
sustenance or rest, to guard their dungeons. Magic traps can attack
intruders by summoning monsters into the dungeon. These guardians also
need no sustenance, since they appear only when they&rsquo;re needed
and disappear when their task is done.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Cavern Complex:</span>
Underground caves provide homes for all sorts of subterranean monsters.
Created naturally and connected by a labyrinthine tunnel system, these
caverns lack any sort of pattern, order, or decoration. With no
intelligent force behind its construction, this type of dungeon is the
least likely to have traps or even doors.</p>

      
      <p>Fungi of all sorts thrive in caves, sometimes growing in huge
forests of mushrooms and puffballs. Subterranean predators prowl these
forests, looking for those feeding upon the fungi. Some varieties of
fungus give off a phosphorescent glow, providing a natural cavern
complex with its own limited light source. In other areas, a daylight
spell or similar magical effect can provide enough light for green
plants to grow.</p>

      
      <p>Often, a natural cavern complex connects with another type of
dungeons, the caves having been discovered when the manufactured
dungeon was delved. A cavern complex can connect two otherwise
unrelated dungeons, sometimes creating a strange mixed environment. A
natural cavern complex joined with another dungeon often provides a
route by which subterranean creatures find their way into a
manufactured dungeon and populate it.
