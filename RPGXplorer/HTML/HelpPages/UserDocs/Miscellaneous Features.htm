      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stairs:</span> The usual way
to connect different levels of a dungeon is with stairs. Straight
stairways, spiral staircases, or stairwells with multiple landings
between flights of stairs are all common in dungeons, as are ramps
(sometimes with an incline so slight that it can be difficult to
notice; Spot DC 15). Stairs are important accessways, and are sometimes
guarded or trapped. Traps on stairs often cause intruders to slide or
fall down to the bottom, where a pit, spikes, a pool of acid, or some
other danger awaits.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gradual Stairs:</span>
Stairs that rise less than 5 feet for every 5 feet of horizontal
distance they cover don&rsquo;t affect movement, but characters who
attack a foe below them gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls from being on
higher ground. Most stairs in dungeons are gradual, except for spiral
stairs (see below).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Steep Stairs:</span>
Characters moving up steep stairs (which rise at a 45- degree angle or
steeper) must spend 2 squares of movement to enter each square of
stairs. Characters running or charging down steep stairs must succeed
on a DC 10 Balance check upon entering the first steep stairs square.
Characters who fail stumble and must end their movement 1d2&times;5
feet later. Characters who fail by 5 or more take 1d6 points of damage
and fall prone in the square where they end their movement. Steep
stairs increase the DC of Tumble checks by 5.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spiral Stairs:</span> This
form of steep stairs is designed to make defending a fortress easier.
Characters gain cover against foes below them on spiral stairs because
they can easily duck around the staircase&rsquo;s central support.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings and Low Walls:</span>
Stairs that are open to large rooms often have railings or low walls.
They function as described for ledges (see Special Floors).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bridge:</span> A bridge
connects two higher areas separated by a lower area, stretching across
a chasm, over a river, or above a pit. A simple bridge might be a
single wooden plank, while an elaborate one could be made of mortared
stone with iron supports and side rails.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Narrow Bridge: </span>If a
bridge is particularly narrow, such as a series of planks laid over
lava fissures, treat it as a ledge (see Special Floors). It requires a
Balance check (DC dependent on width) to cross such a bridge.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rope Bridge:</span>
Constructed of wooden planks suspended from ropes, a rope bridge is
convenient because it&rsquo;s portable and can be easily removed. It
takes two full-round actions to untie one end of a rope bridge, but a
DC 15 Use Rope check reduces the time to a move action. If only one of
the two supporting ropes is attached, everyone on the bridge must
succeed on a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid falling off, and thereafter
must make DC 15 Climb checks to move along the remnants of the bridge.
Rope bridges are usually 5 feet wide. The two ropes that support them
have 8 hit points each.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Drawbridge:</span> Some
bridges have mechanisms that allow them to be extended or retracted
from the gap they cross. Typically,&nbsp; the winch mechanism exists on
only one side of the bridge. It takes a move action to lower a
drawbridge, but the bridge doesn&rsquo;t come down until the beginning
of the lowering character&rsquo;s next turn. It takes a full-round
action to raise a drawbridge; the drawbridge is up at the end of the
action. Particularly long or wide drawbridges may take more time to
raise and lower, and some may require Strength checks to rotate the
winch.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Railings and Low Walls:</span>
Some bridges have railings or low walls along the sides. If a bridge
does, the railing or low walls affect Balance checks and bull rush
attempts as described for ledges (see Special Floors). Low walls
likewise provide cover to bridge occupants.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chutes and Chimneys:</span>
Stairs aren&rsquo;t the only way to move up and down in a dungeon.
Sometimes a vertical shaft connects levels of a dungeon or links a
dungeon with the surface. Chutes are usually traps that dump characters
into a lower area-often a place featuring some dangerous situation with
which they must contend.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pillar:</span> A common sight
in any dungeon, pillars and columns give support to ceilings. The
larger the room, the more likely it has pillars. As a rule of thumb,
the deeper in the dungeon a room is, the thicker the pillars need to be
to support the overhead weight. Pillars tend to be polished and often
have carvings, paintings, or inscriptions upon them.</p>

      
      <p> <span style="font-style: italic;">Slender Pillar:</span> These
pillars are only a foot or two across, so they don&rsquo;t occupy a
whole square. A creature standing in the same square as a slender
pillar gains a +2 cover bonus to Armor Class and a +1 cover bonus on
Reflex saves (these bonuses don&rsquo;t stack with cover bonuses from
other sources). The presence of a slender pillar does not otherwise
affect a creature&rsquo;s fighting space, because it&rsquo;s assumed
that the creature is using the pillar to its advantage when it can. A
typical slender pillar has AC 4, hardness 8, and 250 hit points.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wide Pillar: </span>These
pillars take up an entire square and provide cover to anyone behind
them. They have AC 3, hardness 8, and 900 hit points. A DC 20 Climb
check is sufficient to climb most pillars; the DC increases to 25 for
polished or unusually slick ones.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stalagmite/Stalactite:</span>
These tapering natural rock columns extend from the floor (stalagmite)
or the ceiling (stalactite). Stalagmites and stalactites function as
slender pillars.<br>

Statue: Most statues function as wide pillars, taking up a square and
providing cover. Some statues are smaller and act as slender pillars. A
DC 15 Climb check allows a character to climb a statue.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tapestry:</span> Elaborately
embroidered patterns or scenes on cloth, tapestries hang from the walls
of well-appointed dungeon rooms or corridors. Crafty builders take
advantage of tapestries to place alcoves, concealed doors, or secret
switches behind them.</p>

      
      <p>Tapestries provide total concealment (50% miss chance) to
characters behind them if they&rsquo;re hanging from the ceiling, or
concealment (20% miss chance) if they&rsquo;re flush with the wall.
Climbing a big tapestry isn&rsquo;t particularly difficult, requiring a
DC 15 Climb check (or DC 10 if a wall is within reach).</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pedestal:</span> Anything
important on display in a dungeon, from a fabulous treasure to a
coffin, tends to rest atop a pedestal or a dais. Raising the object off
the floor focuses attention on it (and, in practical terms, keeps it
safe from any water or other substance that might seep onto the floor).
A pedestal is often trapped to protect whatever sits atop it. It can
conceal a secret trapdoor beneath itself or provide a way to reach a
door in the ceiling above itself.</p>

      
      <p>Only the largest pedestals take up an entire square; most provide no cover.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pool:</span> Pools of water
collect naturally in low spots in dungeons (a dry dungeon is rare).
Pools can also be wells or natural underground springs, or they can be
intentionally created basins, cisterns, and fountains. In any event,
water is fairly common in dungeons, harboring sightless fish and
sometimes aquatic monsters. Pools provide water for dungeon denizens,
and thus are as important an area for a predator to control as a
watering hole aboveground in the wild.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Shallow Pool:</span> If a
square contains a shallow pool, it has roughly 1 foot of standing
water. It costs 2 squares of movement to move into a square with a
shallow pool, and the DC of Tumble checks in such squares increases by
2.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Deep Pool:</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> </span>These
squares have at least 4 feet of standing water. It costs Medium or
larger creatures 4 squares of movement to move into a square with a
deep pool, or characters can swim if they wish. Small or smaller
creatures must swim to move through a square containing a deep pool.
Tumbling is impossible in a deep pool. The water in a deep pool
provides cover for Medium or larger creatures. Smaller creatures gain
improved cover (+8 bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves). Medium or
larger creatures can crouch as a move action to gain this improved
cover. Creatures with this improved cover take a -10 penalty on attacks
against creatures that aren&rsquo;t also underwater. <br>

Deep pool squares are usually clustered together and surrounded by a
ring of shallow pool squares. Both shallow pools and deep pools impose
a -2 circumstance penalty on Move Silently checks.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Special Pools:</span>
Through accident or design, a pool can become magically enhanced.
Rarely, a pool or a fountain may be found that has the ability to
bestow beneficial magic on those who drink from it. However, magic
pools are just as likely to curse the drinker. Typically, water from a
magic pool loses its potency if removed from the pool for more than an
hour or so.</p>

      
      <p>Some pools have fountains. Occasionally these are merely
decorative, but they often serve as the focus of a trap or the source
of a pool&rsquo;s magic.</p>

      
      <p>Most pools are made of water, but anything&rsquo;s possible in
a dungeon. Pools can hold unsavory substances such as blood, poison,
oil, or magma. And even if a pool holds water, it can be holy water,
saltwater, or water tainted with disease.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elevator:</span> In place of
or in addition to stairs, an elevator (essentially an oversized
dumbwaiter) can take inhabitants from one dungeon level to the next.
Such an elevator may be mechanical (using gears, pulleys, and winches)
or magical (such as a levitate spell cast on a movable flat surface). A
mechanical elevator might be as small as a platform that holds one
character at a time, or as large as an entire room that raises and
lowers. A clever builder might design an elevator room that moves up or
down without the occupants&rsquo; knowledge to catch them in a trap, or
one that appears to have moved when it actually remained still.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p>A typical elevator ascends or descends 10 feet per round at
the beginning of the operator&rsquo;s turn (or on initiative count 0 if
it functions without regard to whether creatures are on it. Elevators
can be enclosed, can have railings or low walls, or may simply be
treacherous floating platforms.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ladders:</span> Whether free-standing or rungs set into a wall, a ladder requires a DC 0 Climb check to ascend or descend.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shifting Stone or Wall:</span>
These features can cut off access to a passage or room, trapping
adventurers in a dead end or preventing escape out of the dungeon.
Shifting walls can force explorers to go down a dangerous path or
prevent them from entering a special area. Not all shifting walls need
be traps. For example, stones controlled by pressure plates,
counterweights, or a secret lever can shift out of a wall to become a
staircase leading to a hidden upper room or secret ledge.</p>

      
      <p>Shifting stones and walls are generally constructed as traps
with triggers and Search and Disable Device DCs. However they
don&rsquo;t have Challenge Ratings because they&rsquo;re
inconveniences, not deadly in and of themselves.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teleporters:</span> Sometimes
useful, sometimes devious, places in a dungeon rigged with a
teleportation effect (such as a teleportation circle) transport
characters to some other location in the dungeon or someplace far away.
They can be traps, teleporting the unwary into dangerous situations, or
they can be an easy mode of transport for those who built or live in
the dungeon, good for bypassing barriers and traps or simply to get
around more quickly. Devious dungeon designers might place a teleporter
in a room that transports characters to another seemingly identical
room so that they don&rsquo;t even know they&rsquo;ve been teleported.
A detect magic spell will provide a clue to the presence of a
teleporter, but direct experimentation or other research is the only
way to discover where the teleporter leads.</p>

      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Altars:</span>
Temples-particularly to dark gods-often exist underground. Usually
taking the form of a stone block, an altar is the main fixture and
central focus of such a temple. Sometimes all the other trappings of
the temple are long gone, lost to theft, age, and decay, but the altar
survives. Some altars have traps or powerful magic within them. Most
take up one or two squares on the grid and provide cover to creatures
behind them.
