      <p>Monsters are assumed to have completely average (or standard)
ability scores - a 10 or an 11 in each ability, as modified by their
racial bonuses. However, improved monsters are individuals and often
have better than normal ability scores, and usually make use of either
the elite array or the nonelite array of ability scores. Monsters who
improve by adding a template, and monsters who improve by increasing
their Hit Dice, may use any of the three arrays (standard, nonelite, or
elite). Any monster unique enough to be improved could easily be
considered elite.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Elite Array:</span> The elite
array is 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. While the monster has one weakness
compared to a typical member of its race, it is significantly better
overall. The elite array is most appropriate for monsters who add
levels in a player character class.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nonelite Array:</span> The
nonelite array is 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8. The nonelite array does not
necessarily make a monster better than normal, but it does customize
the monster as an individual with strengths and weaknesses compared to
a typical member of its race. The nonelite array is most appropriate
for monsters who add class levels in a NPC class.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Score Improvement:</span>
Treat monster Hit Dice the same as character level for determining
ability score increases. This only applies to Hit Dice increases,
monsters do not gain ability score increases for levels they
&ldquo;already reached&rdquo; with their racial Hit Dice, since these
adjustments are included in their basic ability scores.</p>
