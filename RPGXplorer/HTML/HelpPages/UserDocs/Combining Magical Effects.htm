      <p>Spells or magical effects usually work as described, no matter
how many other spells or magical effects happen to be operating in the
same area or on the same recipient. Except in special cases, a spell
does not affect the way another spell operates. Whenever a spell has a
specific effect on other spells, the spell description explains that
effect. Several other general rules apply when spells or magical
effects operate in the same place:</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stacking Effects:</span>
Spells that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls,
saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with
themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don&rsquo;t
stack even if they come from different spells (or from effects other
than spells; see Bonus Types, above).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different Bonus Names:</span>
The bonuses or penalties from two different spells stack if the
modifiers are of different types. A bonus that isn&rsquo;t named stacks
with any bonus.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </span>In
cases when two or more identical spells are operating in the same area
or on the same target, but at different strengths, only the best one
applies.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect with Differing Results:</span>
The same spell can sometimes produce varying effects if applied to the
same recipient more than once. Usually the last spell in the series
trumps the others. None of the previous spells are actually removed or
dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant while the final spell in
the series lasts.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </span>Sometimes,
one spell can render a later spell irrelevant. Both spells are still
active, but one has rendered the other useless in some fashion.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple Mental Control Effects:</span>
Sometimes magical effects that establish mental control render each
other irrelevant, such as a spell that removes the subjects ability to
act. Mental controls that don&rsquo;t remove the recipient&rsquo;s
ability to act usually do not interfere with each other. If a creature
is under the mental control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey
each to the best of its ability, and to the extent of the control each
effect allows. If the controlled creature receives conflicting orders
simultaneously, the competing controllers must make opposed Charisma
checks to determine which one the creature obeys.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spells with Opposite Effects:</span>
Spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all bonuses,
penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply. Some
spells negate or counter each other. This is a special effect that is
noted in a spell&rsquo;s description.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instantaneous Effects:</span> Two or more spells with instantaneous durations work cumulatively when they affect the same target.
