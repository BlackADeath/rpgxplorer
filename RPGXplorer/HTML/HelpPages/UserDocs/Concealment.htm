      <p>To determine whether your target has concealment from your
ranged attack, choose a corner of your square. If any line from this
corner to any corner of the target&rsquo;s square passes through a
square or border that provides concealment, the target has concealment.</p>
      <p>When making a melee attack against an adjacent target, your
target has concealment if his space is entirely within an effect that
grants concealment. When making a melee attack against a target that
isn&rsquo;t adjacent to you use the rules for determining concealment
from ranged attacks.</p>
      <p>In addition, some magical effects provide concealment against
all attacks, regardless of whether any intervening concealment exists.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concealment Miss Chance:</span>
Concealment gives the subject of a successful attack a 20% chance that
the attacker missed because of the concealment. If the attacker hits,
the defender must make a miss chance percentile roll to avoid being
struck. Multiple concealment conditions do not stack.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concealment and Hide Checks:</span> You can use concealment to make a Hide check. Without concealment, you usually need cover to make a Hide check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Total Concealment:</span> If
you have line of effect to a target but not line of sight he is
considered to have total concealment from you. You can&rsquo;t attack
an opponent that has total concealment, though you can attack into a
square that you think he occupies. A successful attack into a square
occupied by an enemy with total concealment has a 50% miss chance
(instead of the normal 20% miss chance for an opponent with
concealment).</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t execute an attack of opportunity against an
opponent with total concealment, even if you know what square or
squares the opponent occupies.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ignoring Concealment:</span>
Concealment isn&rsquo;t always effective. A shadowy area or darkness
doesn&rsquo;t provide any concealment against an opponent with
darkvision. Characters with low-light vision can see clearly for a
greater distance with the same light source than other characters.
Although invisibility provides total concealment, sighted opponents may
still make Spot checks to notice the location of an invisible
character. An invisible character gains a +20 bonus on Hide checks if
moving, or a +40 bonus on Hide checks when not moving (even though
opponents can&rsquo;t see you, they might be able to figure out where
you are from other visual clues).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Varying Degrees of Concealment:</span> Certain situations may provide more or less than typical concealment, and modify the miss chance accordingly.
