      <p>Lawful characters tell the truth, keep their word, respect
authority, honor tradition, and judge those who fall short of their
duties.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Chaotic characters follow their consciences, resent being told
what to do, favor new ideas over tradition, and do what they promise if
they feel like it.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Law&rdquo; implies honor, trustworthiness, obedience to
authority, and reliability. On the downside, lawfulness can include
close-mindedness, reactionary adherence to tradition, judgmentalness,
and a lack of adaptability. Those who consciously promote lawfulness
say that only lawful behavior creates a society in which people can
depend on each other and make the right decisions in full confidence
that others will act as they should.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Chaos&rdquo; implies freedom, adaptability, and
flexibility. On the downside, chaos can include recklessness,
resentment toward legitimate authority, arbitrary actions, and
irresponsibility. Those who promote chaotic behavior say that only
unfettered personal freedom allows people to express themselves fully
and lets society benefit from the potential that its individuals have
within them.</p>
      <p>Someone who is neutral with respect to law and chaos has a
normal respect for authority and feels neither a compulsion to obey nor
a compulsion to rebel. She is honest but can be tempted into lying or
deceiving others.</p>
      <p>Devotion to law or chaos may be a conscious choice, but more
often it is a personality trait that is recognized rather than being
chosen. Neutrality on the lawful&ndash;chaotic axis is usually simply a
middle state, a state of not feeling compelled toward one side or the
other. Some few such neutrals, however, espouse neutrality as superior
to law or chaos, regarding each as an extreme with its own blind spots
and drawbacks.</p>
      <p>Animals and other creatures incapable of moral action are
neutral. Dogs may be obedient and cats free-spirited, but they do not
have the moral capacity to be truly lawful or chaotic.
