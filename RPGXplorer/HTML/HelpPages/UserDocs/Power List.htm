      <p>An <sup>A</sup> appearing at the end of a power&rsquo;s name in the power lists denotes an augmentable power. An <sup>X</sup> denotes a power with an XP component paid by the manifester.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Chains: </span>Some
powers reference other powers that they are based upon. Only
information in a power later in the power chain that is different from
the base power is covered in the power being described. Header entries
and other information that are the same as the base power are not
repeated. The same holds true for powers that are the equivalents of
spells, only the way the power varies from the spell is noted, such as
power point cost.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Order of Presentation:</span>
In the power lists and the power descriptions that follow them, the
powers are presented in alphabetical order by name - except for those
belonging to certain power chains and those that are psionic
equivalents of spells. When a power&rsquo;s name begins with
&ldquo;lesser,&rdquo; &ldquo;greater,&rdquo; &ldquo;mass,&rdquo; or a
similar kind of qualifier, the power description is alphabetized under
the second word of the power description instead. When the effect of a
power is essentially the same as that of a spell, the power&rsquo;s
name is simply &ldquo;Psionic&rdquo; followed by the name of the spell,
and it is alphabetized according to the spell name.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifester Level: </span>A
power&rsquo;s effect often depends on the manifester level, which is
the manifester&rsquo;s psionic class level. A creature with no classes
has a manifester level equal to its Hit Dice unless otherwise
specified. The word &ldquo;level&rdquo; in the power lists always
refers to manifester level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creatures and Characters:</span> &ldquo;Creatures&rdquo; and &ldquo;characters&rdquo; are used synonymously in the power descriptions.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> Many powers
vary in strength depending on how many power points you put into them.
The more power points you spend, the more powerful the manifestation.
However, you can spend only a total number of points on a power equal
to your manifester level, unless you have an ability that increases
your effective manifester level.</p>
      <p>Many powers can be augmented in more than one way. When the
Augment section contains numbered paragraphs, you need to spend power
points separately for each of the numbered options. When a paragraph in
the Augment section begins with &ldquo;In addition,&rdquo; you gain the
indicated benefit according to how many power points you have already
decided to spend on manifesting the power.</p>
