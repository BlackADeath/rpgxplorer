      <p>To create a magic weapon, a character needs a heat source and
some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. She also needs a supply of
materials, the most obvious being the weapon or the pieces of the
weapon to be assembled. Only a masterwork weapon can become a magic
weapon, and the masterwork cost is added to the total cost to determine
final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials
are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic weapon - half the base
price given on Table: Weapons, according to the weapon&rsquo;s total
effective bonus.</p>
      <p>Creating a magic weapon has a special prerequisite: The
creator&rsquo;s caster level must be at least three times the
enhancement bonus of the weapon. If an item has both an enhancement
bonus and a special ability the higher of the two caster level
requirements must be met.</p>
      <p>A magic weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus to
have any of the abilities listed on Table: Melee Weapon Special
Abilities or Table Ranged Weapon Special Abilities.</p>
      <p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the
weapon, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must
know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard) but need not
provide any material components or focuses the spells require, nor are
any XP costs inherent in a prerequisite spell incurred in the creation
of the item. The act of working on the weapon triggers the prepared
spells, making them unavailable for casting during each day of the
weapon&rsquo;s creation. (That is, those spell slots are expended from
his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been cast.)</p>
      <p>At the time of creation, the creator must decide if the weapon
glows or not as a side-effect of the magic imbued within it. This
decision does not affect the price or the creation time, but once the
item is finished, the decision is binding.</p>
      <p>Creating magic double-headed weapons is treated as creating two weapons when determining cost, time, XP, and special abilities.</p>
      <p>Creating some weapons may entail other prerequisites beyond or
other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
      <p>Crafting a magic weapon requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.</p>
