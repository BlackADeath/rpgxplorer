      <p>A lich is an undead spellcaster, usually a wizard or sorcerer
but sometimes a cleric or other spellcaster, who has used its magical
powers to unnaturally extend its life.</p>
      <p>A lich is a gaunt and skeletal humanoid with withered flesh
stretched tight across horribly visible bones. Its eyes have long ago
been lost to decay, but bright pinpoints of crimson light burn on in
the empty sockets.</p>
      <p>Liches speak Common plus any other languages they knew in life.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a Lich: </span>&ldquo;Lich&rdquo;
is an acquired template that can be added to any humanoid creature
(referred to hereafter as the base creature), provided it can create
the required phylactery; see The Lich&rsquo;s Phylactery, below.</p>
      <p>A lich has all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size and Type: </span>The creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. Size is unchanged.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice: </span>Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> A lich has a +5 natural armor bonus or the base creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus, whichever is better.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack:</span> A lich has a
touch attack that it can use once per round. If the base creature can
use weapons, the lich retains this ability. A creature with natural
weapons retains those natural weapons. A lich fighting without weapons
uses either its touch attack or its primary natural weapon (if it has
any). A lich armed with a weapon uses its touch or a weapon, as it
desires.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Attack:</span> A lich
fighting without weapons uses either its touch attack (see above) or
its natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually
uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a touch as a natural
secondary attack, provided it has a way to make that attack (either a
free hand or a natural weapon that it can use as a secondary attack).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage: </span>A lich without
natural weapons has a touch attack that uses negative energy to deal
1d8+5 points of damage to living creatures; a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2
lich&rsquo;s HD + lich&rsquo;s Cha modifier) halves the damage. A lich
with natural weapons can use its touch attack or its natural weaponry,
as it prefers. If it chooses the latter, it deals 1d8+5 points of extra
damage on one natural weapon attack.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks:</span> A
lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special attacks and gains
those described below. Save DCs are equal to 10 + 1/2 lich&rsquo;s HD +
lich&rsquo;s Cha modifier unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fear Aura (Su):</span>
Liches are shrouded in a dreadful aura of death and evil. Creatures of
less than 5 HD in a 60-foot radius that look at the lich must succeed
on a Will save or be affected as though by a fear spell from a sorcerer
of the lich&rsquo;s level. A creature that successfully saves cannot be
affected again by the same lich&rsquo;s aura for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Paralyzing Touch (Su):</span> Any living creature a lich hits with its touch attack must succeed on a Fortitude save or be permanently paralyzed. <span style="font-style: italic;">Remove paralysis</span> or any spell that can remove a curse can free the victim (see the <span style="font-style: italic;">bestow curse</span> spell description).</p>
      <p>The effect cannot be dispelled. Anyone paralyzed by a lich
seems dead, though a DC 20 Spot check or a DC 15 Heal check reveals
that the victim is still alive.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spells:</span> A lich can cast any spells it could cast while alive.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities:</span> A lich retains all the base creature&rsquo;s special qualities and gains those described below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Turn Resistance (Ex):</span> A lich has +4 turn resistance.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage Reduction (Su):</span>
A lich&rsquo;s undead body is tough, giving the creature damage
reduction 15/bludgeoning and magic. Its natural weapons are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immunities (Ex):</span>
Liches have immunity to cold, electricity, polymorph (though they can
use polymorph effects on themselves), and mind-affecting attacks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities: </span>Increase from the base creature as follows: Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a lich has no Constitution score.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills: </span>Liches have a
+8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense Motive,
and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span> Solitary or troupe (1 lich, plus 2&ndash;4 vampires and 5&ndash;8 vampire spawn).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span> Same as the base creature + 2.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure: </span>Standard coins; double goods; double items.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> Any evil.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advancement:</span> By character class.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level Adjustment:</span> Same as the base creature +4.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lich Characters: </span>The
process of becoming a lich is unspeakably evil and can be undertaken
only by a willing character. A lich retains all class abilities it had
in life.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Lich's Phylactery:</span>
An integral part of becoming a lich is creating a magic phylactery in
which the character stores its life force. As a rule, the only way to
get rid of a lich for sure is to destroy its phylactery. Unless its
phylactery is located and destroyed, a lich reappears 1d10 days after
its apparent death.</p>
      <p>Each lich must make its own phylactery, which requires the
Craft Wondrous Item feat. The character must be able to cast spells and
have a caster level of 11th or higher. The phylactery costs 120,000 gp
and 4,800 XP to create and has a caster level equal to that of its
creator at the time of creation.</p>
      <p>The most common form of phylactery is a sealed metal box
containing strips of parchment on which magical phrases have been
transcribed. The box is Tiny and has 40 hit points, hardness 20, and a
break DC of 40.</p>
      <p>Other forms of phylacteries can exist, such as rings, amulets, or similar items.
