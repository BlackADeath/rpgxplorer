      <p>Ghosts are the spectral remnants of intelligent beings who, for one reason or another, cannot rest easily in their graves.</p>
      <p>A ghost greatly resembles its corporeal form in life, but in some cases the spiritual form is somewhat altered. <br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a Ghost:</span>
&ldquo;Ghost&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any
aberration, animal, dragon, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous
humanoid, or plant. The creature (referred to hereafter as the base
creature) must have a Charisma score of at least 6.</p>
      <p>A ghost uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size and Type:</span> The
creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead. Do not recalculate the
creature&rsquo;s base attack bonus, saves, or skill points. It gains
the incorporeal subtype. Size is unchanged.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice:</span> All current and future Hit Dice become d12s.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> Ghosts have a fly speed of 30 feet, unless the base creature has a higher fly speed, with perfect maneuverability.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> Natural
armor is the same as the base creature&rsquo;s but applies only to
ethereal encounters. When the ghost manifests (see below), its natural
armor bonus is +0, but it gains a deflection bonus equal to its
Charisma modifier or +1, whichever is higher.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack:</span> A ghost
retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on
physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Attack:</span> A ghost
retains all the attacks of the base creature, although those relying on
physical contact do not affect creatures that are not ethereal.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage:</span> Against
ethereal creatures, a ghost uses the base creature&rsquo;s damage
values. Against nonethereal creatures, the ghost usually cannot deal
physical damage at all but can use its special attacks, if any, when it
manifests (see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks:</span> A
ghost retains all the special attacks of the base creature, although
those relying on physical contact do not affect nonethereal creatures.
The ghost also gains a manifestation ability plus one to three other
special attacks as described below. The save DC against a special
attack is equal to 10 + 1/2 ghost&rsquo;s HD + ghost&rsquo;s Cha
modifier unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Corrupting Gaze</span> (Su):
A ghost can blast living beings with a glance, at a range of up to 30
feet. Creatures that meet the ghost&rsquo;s gaze must succeed on a
Fortitude save or take 2d10 points of damage and 1d4 points of Charisma
damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Corrupting Touch</span>
(Su): A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch
attack deals 1d6 points of damage. Against ethereal opponents, it adds
its Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls. Against nonethereal
opponents, it adds its Dexterity modifier to attack rolls only.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Draining Touch</span> (Su):
A ghost that hits a living target with its incorporeal touch attack
drains 1d4 points from any one ability score it selects. On each such
successful attack, the ghost heals 5 points of damage to itself.
Against ethereal opponents, it adds its Strength modifier to attack
rolls only. Against nonethereal opponents, it adds its Dexterity
modifier to attack rolls only.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Frightful Moan</span> (Su):
A ghost can emit a frightful moan as a standard action. All living
creatures within a 30-foot spread must succeed on a Will save or become
panicked for 2d4 rounds. This is a sonic necromantic mind-affecting
fear effect. A creature that successfully saves against the moan cannot
be affected by the same ghost&rsquo;s moan for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Horrific Appearance</span>
(Su): Any living creature within 60 feet that views a ghost must
succeed on a Fortitude save or immediately take 1d4 points of Strength
damage, 1d4 points of Dexterity damage, and 1d4 points of Constitution
damage. A creature that successfully saves against this effect cannot
be affected by the same ghost&rsquo;s horrific appearance for 24 hours.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Malevolence</span> (Su): Once per round, an ethereal ghost can merge its body with a creature on the Material Plane. This ability is similar to a <span style="font-style: italic;">magic jar</span>
spell (caster level 10th or the ghost&rsquo;s Hit Dice, whichever is
higher), except that it does not require a receptacle. To use this
ability, the ghost must be manifested and it must try move into the
target&rsquo;s space; moving into the target&rsquo;s space to use the
malevolence ability does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The target
can resist the attack with a successful Will save (DC 15 +
ghost&rsquo;s Cha modifier). A creature that successfully saves is
immune to that same ghost&rsquo;s malevolence for 24 hours, and the
ghost cannot enter the target&rsquo;s space. If the save fails, the
ghost vanishes into the target&rsquo;s body.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Manifestation</span> (Su):
Every ghost has this ability. A ghost dwells on the Ethereal Plane and,
as an ethereal creature, it cannot affect or be affected by anything in
the material world. When a ghost manifests, it partly enters the
Material Plane and becomes visible but incorporeal on the Material
Plane. A manifested ghost can be harmed only by other incorporeal
creatures, magic weapons, or spells, with a 50% chance to ignore any
damage from a corporeal source. A manifested ghost can pass through
solid objects at will, and its own attacks pass through armor. A
manifested ghost always moves silently. A manifested ghost can strike
with its touch attack or with a ghost touch weapon (see Ghostly
Equipment, below). A manifested ghost remains partially on the Ethereal
Plane, where is it not incorporeal. A manifested ghost can be attacked
by opponents on either the Material Plane or the Ethereal Plane. The
ghost&rsquo;s incorporeality helps protect it from foes on the Material
Plane, but not from foes on the Ethereal Plane.</p>
      <p>When a spellcasting ghost is not manifested and is on the
Ethereal Plane, its spells cannot affect targets on the Material Plane,
but they work normally against ethereal targets. When a spellcasting
ghost manifests, its spells continue to affect ethereal targets and can
affect targets on the Material Plane normally unless the spells rely on
touch. A manifested ghost&rsquo;s touch spells don&rsquo;t work on
nonethereal targets.</p>
      <p>A ghost has two home planes, the Material Plane and the
Ethereal Plane. It is not considered extraplanar when on either of
these planes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Telekinesis</span> (Su): A
ghost can use telekinesis as a standard action (caster level 12th or
equal to the ghost&rsquo;s HD, whichever is higher). When a ghost uses
this power, it must wait 1d4 rounds before using it again.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities: </span>A ghost has all the special qualities of the base creature as well as those described below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Rejuvenation </span>(Su): In
most cases, it&rsquo;s difficult to destroy a ghost through simple
combat: The &ldquo;destroyed&rdquo; spirit will often restore itself in
2d4 days. Even the most powerful spells are usually only temporary
solutions. A ghost that would otherwise be destroyed returns to its old
haunts with a successful level check (1d20 + ghost&rsquo;s HD) against
DC 16. As a rule, the only way to get rid of a ghost for sure is to
determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents
it from resting in peace. The exact means varies with each spirit and
may require a good deal of research.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Turn Resistance </span>(Ex): A ghost has +4 turn resistance.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities:</span> Same as the base creature, except that the ghost has no Constitution score, and its Charisma score increases by +4.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills:</span> Ghosts have a +8 racial bonus on Hide, Listen, Search, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment:</span> Any, often as base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span> Solitary, gang (2&ndash;4), or mob (7&ndash;12).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating: </span>Same as the base creature +2.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure:</span> None.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> Any.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level Adjustment:</span> Same as the base creature +5.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ghostly Equipment:</span> When a
ghost forms, all its equipment and carried items usually become
ethereal along with it. In addition, the ghost retains 2d4 items that
it particularly valued in life (provided they are not in another
creature&rsquo;s possession). The equipment works normally on the
Ethereal Plane but passes harmlessly through material objects or
creatures. A weapon of +1 or better magical enhancement, however, can
harm material creatures when the ghost manifests, but any such attack
has a 50% chance to fail unless the weapon is a ghost touch weapon
(just as magic weapons can fail to harm the ghost).</p>
      <p>The original material items remain behind, just as the
ghost&rsquo;s physical remains do. If another creature seizes the
original, the ethereal copy fades away. This loss invariably angers the
ghost, who stops at nothing to return the item to its original resting
place.
