      <p>Vampires appear just as they did in life, although their
features are often hardened and feral, with the predatory look of
wolves.</p>
      <p>Like liches, they often embrace finery and decadence and may
assume the guise of nobility. Despite their human appearance, vampires
can be easily recognized, for they cast no shadows and throw no
reflections in mirrors.</p>
      <p>Vampires speak any languages they knew in life.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating a Vampire:</span>
&ldquo;Vampire&rdquo; is an acquired template that can be added to any
humanoid or monstrous humanoid creature (referred to hereafter as the
base creature).<br>
A vampire uses all the base creature&rsquo;s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size and Type:</span> The
creature&rsquo;s type changes to undead (augmented humanoid or
monstrous humanoid). Do not recalculate base attack bonus, saves, or
skill points. Size is unchanged.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice: </span>Increase all current and future Hit Dice to d12s.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> Same as the
base creature. If the base creature has a swim speed, the vampire
retains the ability to swim and is not vulnerable to immersion in
running water (see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> The base creature&rsquo;s natural armor bonus improves by +6.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack:</span> A vampire
retains all the attacks of the base creature and also gains a slam
attack if it didn&rsquo;t already have one. If the base creature can
use weapons, the vampire retains this ability. A creature with natural
weapons retains those natural weapons. A vampire fighting without
weapons uses either its slam attack or its primary natural weapon (if
it has any). A vampire armed with a weapon uses its slam or a weapon,
as it desires.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Attack:</span> A vampire
fighting without weapons uses either its slam attack (see above) or its
natural weapons (if it has any). If armed with a weapon, it usually
uses the weapon as its primary attack along with a slam or other
natural weapon as a natural secondary attack.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage:</span> Vampires have
slam attacks. If the base creature does not have this attack form, use
the appropriate damage value from the table below according to the
vampire&rsquo;s size. Creatures that have other kinds of natural
weapons retain their old damage values or use the appropriate value
from the table below, whichever is better.</p>

      </table>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks:</span> A
vampire retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains
those described below. Saves have a DC of 10 + 1/2 vampire&rsquo;s HD +
vampire&rsquo;s Cha modifier unless noted otherwise.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Blood Drain (Ex):</span>
A vampire can suck blood from a living victim with its fangs by making
a successful grapple check. If it pins the foe, it drains blood,
dealing 1d4 points of Constitution drain each round the pin is
maintained. On each such successful attack, the vampire gains 5
temporary hit points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Children of the Night (Su):</span>
Vampires command the lesser creatures of the world and once per day can
call forth 1d6+1 rat swarms, 1d4+1 bat swarms, or a pack of 3d6 wolves
as a standard action. (If the base creature is not terrestrial, this
power might summon other creatures of similar power.) These creatures
arrive in 2d6 rounds and serve the vampire for up to 1 hour.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Dominate (Su):</span>
A vampire can crush an opponent&rsquo;s will just by looking onto his
or her eyes. This is similar to a gaze attack, except that the vampire
must use a standard action, and those merely looking at it are not
affected. Anyone the vampire targets must succeed on a Will save or
fall instantly under the vampire&rsquo;s influence as though by a <span style="font-style: italic;">dominate person </span>spell (caster level 12th). The ability has a range of 30 feet.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Create Spawn (Su):</span>
A humanoid or monstrous humanoid slain by a vampire&rsquo;s energy
drain rises as a vampire spawn (see the Vampire Spawn entry) 1d4 days
after burial. </p>
      <p>If the vampire instead drains the victim&rsquo;s Constitution
to 0 or lower, the victim returns as a spawn if it had 4 or less HD and
as a vampire if it had 5 or more HD. In either case, the new vampire or
spawn is under the command of the vampire that created it and remains
enslaved until its master&rsquo;s destruction. At any given time a
vampire may have enslaved spawn totaling no more than twice its own Hit
Dice; any spawn it creates that would exceed this limit are created as
free-willed vampires or vampire spawn. A vampire that is enslaved may
create and enslave spawn of its own, so a master vampire can control a
number of lesser vampires in this fashion. A vampire may voluntarily
free an enslaved spawn in order to enslave a new spawn, but once freed,
a vampire or vampire spawn cannot be enslaved again.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Energy Drain (Su):</span>
Living creatures hit by a vampire&rsquo;s slam attack (or any other
natural weapon the vampire might possess) gain two negative levels. For
each negative level bestowed, the vampire gains 5 temporary hit points.
A vampire can use its energy drain ability once per round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Qualities:</span> A vampire retains all the special qualities of the base creature and gains those described below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Alternate Form (Su):</span> A vampire can assume the shape of a bat, dire bat, wolf, or dire wolf as a standard action. This ability is similar to a <span style="font-style: italic;">polymorph</span>
spell cast by a 12th-level character, except that the vampire does not
regain hit points for changing form and must choose from among the
forms mentioned here. While in its alternate form, the vampire loses
its natural slam attack and dominate ability, but it gains the natural
weapons and extraordinary special attacks of its new form. It can
remain in that form until it assumes another or until the next sunrise.
(If the base creature is not terrestrial, this power might allow other
forms.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Damage Reduction (Su):</span>
A vampire has damage reduction 10/silver and magic. A vampire&rsquo;s
natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Fast Healing (Ex):</span> A
vampire heals 5 points of damage each round so long as it has at least
1 hit point. If reduced to 0 hit points in combat, it automatically
assumes gaseous form and attempts to escape. It must reach its coffin
home within 2 hours or be utterly destroyed. (It can travel up to nine
miles in 2 hours.) Any additional damage dealt to a vampire forced into
gaseous form has no effect. Once at rest in its coffin, a vampire is
helpless. It regains 1 hit point after 1 hour, then is no longer
helpless and resumes healing at the rate of 5 hit points per round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Gaseous Form (Su):</span> As
a standard action, a vampire can assume gaseous form at will as the
spell (caster level 5th), but it can remain gaseous indefinitely and
has a fly speed of 20 feet with perfect maneuverability.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Resistances (Ex):</span> A vampire has resistance to cold 10 and electricity 10.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spider Climb (Ex):</span> A vampire can climb sheer surfaces as though with a <span style="font-style: italic;">spider climb</span> spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Turn Resistance (Ex):</span> A vampire has +4 turn resistance. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities:</span> Increase
from the base creature as follows: Str +6, Dex +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha
+4. As an undead creature, a vampire has no Constitution score.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills: </span>Vampires have
a +8 racial bonus on Bluff, Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Search, Sense
Motive, and Spot checks. Otherwise same as the base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats: </span>Vampires gain
Alertness, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Improved Initiative, and Lightning
Reflexes, assuming the base creature meets the prerequisites and
doesn&rsquo;t already have these feats.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment:</span> Any, usually same as base creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization: </span>Solitary, pair, gang (3&ndash;5), or troupe (1&ndash;2 plus 2&ndash;5 vampire spawn)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span> Same as the base creature +2.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure: </span>Double standard.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> Always evil (any).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advancement:</span> By character class.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level Adjustment:</span> Same as the base creature +8.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vampire Weaknesses:</span> For all their power, vampires have a number of weaknesses.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Repelling a Vampire: </span>Vampires
cannot tolerate the strong odor of garlic and will not enter an area
laced with it. Similarly, they recoil from a mirror or a strongly
presented holy symbol. These things don&rsquo;t harm the vampire - they
merely keep it at bay. A recoiling vampire must stay at least 5 feet
away from a creature holding the mirror or holy symbol and cannot touch
or make melee attacks against the creature holding the item for the
rest of the encounter. Holding a vampire at bay takes a standard action.</p>
      <p>Vampires are also unable to cross running water, although they
can be carried over it while resting in their coffins or aboard a ship.</p>
      <p>They are utterly unable to enter a home or other building
unless invited in by someone with the authority to do so. They may
freely enter public places, since these are by definition open to all. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Slaying a Vampire: </span>Reducing
a vampire&rsquo;s hit points to 0 or lower incapacitates it but
doesn&rsquo;t always destroy it (see the note on fast healing).
However, certain attacks can slay vampires. Exposing any vampire to
direct sunlight disorients it: It can take only a single move action or
attack action and is destroyed utterly in the next round if it cannot
escape. Similarly, immersing a vampire in running water robs it of
one-third of its hit points each round until it is destroyed at the end
of the third round of immersion. Driving a wooden stake through a
vampire&rsquo;s heart instantly slays the monster. However, it returns
to life if the stake is removed, unless the body is destroyed. A
popular tactic is to cut off the creature&rsquo;s head and fill its
mouth with holy wafers (or their equivalent).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vampire Characters: </span>Vampires
are always evil, which causes characters of certain classes to lose
some class abilities. In addition,&nbsp; certain classes take
additional penalties.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Clerics:</span> Vampire
clerics lose their ability to turn undead but gain the ability to
rebuke undead. This ability does not affect the vampire&rsquo;s
controller or any other vampires that a master controls. A vampire
cleric has access to two of the following domains: Chaos, Destruction,
Evil, or Trickery.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sorcerers and Wizards: </span>Vampire
sorcerers and wizards retain their class abilities, but if a character
has a familiar other than a rat or bat, the link between them is
broken, and the familiar shuns its former companion. The character can
summon another familiar, but it must be a rat or bat.</p>
