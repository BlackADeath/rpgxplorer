      <p>The default rule for the interaction of psionics and magic is
simple: Powers interact with spells and spells interact with powers in
the same way a spell or normal spell-like ability interacts with
another spell or spell-like ability. This is known as psionics - magic
transparency.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psionics - Magic Transparency:</span>
Though not explicitly called out in the spell descriptions or magic
item descriptions, spells, spell-like abilities, and magic items that
could potentially affect psionics do affect psionics. </p>
      <p>When the rule about psionics - magic transparency is in effect, it has the following ramifications.</p>
      <p>Spell resistance is effective against powers, using the same
mechanics. Likewise, power resistance is effective against spells,
using the same mechanics as spell resistance. If a creature has one
kind of resistance, it is assumed to have the other. (The effects have
similar ends despite having been brought about by different means.)</p>
      <p>All spells that dispel magic have equal effect against powers of the same level using the same mechanics, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>The spell <span style="font-style: italic;">detect magic</span>
detects powers, their number, and their strength and location within 3
rounds (though a Psicraft check is necessary to identify the discipline
of the psionic aura).</p>
      <p>Dead magic areas are also dead psionics areas.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Effects:</span>
Powers or psionic effects usually work as described no matter how many
other powers, psionic effects, spells, or magical effects happen to be
operating in the same area or on the same recipient. Except in special
cases, a power does not affect the way another power or spell operates.
Whenever a power has a specific effect on other powers or spells, the
power description explains the effect (and vice versa for spells that
affect powers). Several other general rules apply when powers, spells,
magical effects, or psionic effects operate in the same place.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stacking Effects:</span>
Powers that provide bonuses or penalties on attack rolls, damage rolls,
saving throws, and other attributes usually do not stack with
themselves. More generally, two bonuses of the same type don&rsquo;t
stack even if they come from different powers, or one from a power and
one from a spell. You use whichever bonus gives you the better result. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Different Bonus Types:</span>
The bonuses or penalties from two different powers, or a power and a
spell, stack if the effects are of different types. A bonus that
isn&rsquo;t named (just a &ldquo;+2 bonus&rdquo; rather than a
&ldquo;+2 insight bonus&rdquo;) stacks with any bonus.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect More than Once in Different Strengths: </span>In
cases when two or more similar or identical effects are operating in
the same area or on the same target, but at different strengths, only
the best one applies. If one power or spell is dispelled or its
duration runs out, the other power or spell remains in effect (assuming
its duration has not yet expired).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Same Effect with Differing Results:</span>
The same power or spell can sometimes produce varying effects if
applied to the same recipient more than once. The last effect in a
series trumps the others. None of the previous spells or powers are
actually removed or dispelled, but their effects become irrelevant
while the final spell or power in the series lasts.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">One Effect Makes Another Irrelevant: </span>Sometimes, a power can render another power irrelevant.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Multiple Mental Control Effects:</span>
Sometimes psionic or magical effects that establish mental control
render one another irrelevant. Mental controls that don&rsquo;t remove
the recipient&rsquo;s ability to act usually do not interfere with one
another, though one may modify another. If a creature is under the
control of two or more creatures, it tends to obey each to the best of
its ability, and to the extent of the control each effect allows. If
the controlled creature receives conflicting orders simultaneously, the
competing controllers must make opposed Charisma checks to determine
which one the creature obeys.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Powers and Spells with Opposite Effects:</span>
Powers and spells with opposite effects apply normally, with all
bonuses, penalties, or changes accruing in the order that they apply.
Some powers and spells negate or counter each other. This is a special
effect that is noted in a power&rsquo;s or spell&rsquo;s description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Instantaneous Effects:</span>
Two or more magical or psionic effects with instantaneous durations
work cumulatively when they affect the same object, place, or creature.
