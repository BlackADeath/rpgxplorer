      <p>Lycanthropes are humanoids or giants who can transform
themselves into animals. In its natural form, a lycanthrope looks like
any other members of its kind, though natural lycanthropes and those
who have been afflicted for a long time tend to have or acquire
features reminiscent of their animal forms. In animal form, a
lycanthrope resembles a powerful version of the normal animal, but on
close inspection, its eyes (which often glow red in the dark) show a
faint spark of unnatural intelligence.</p>
      <p>Lycanthropy can be spread like a disease. Sometimes a
lycanthrope begins life as a normal humanoid or giant who subsequently
contracts lycanthropy after being wounded by a lycanthrope. Such a
creature is called an afflicted lycanthrope. Other lycanthropes are
born as lycanthropes, and are known as natural lycanthropes.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat:</span> A lycanthrope
in its humanoid (or giant) form uses whatever tactics and weapons are
favored by others of its kind, though it tends to be slightly more
aggressive. A lycanthrope possesses the senses of its animal form,
including scent and low-light vision, and it has a deep empathy for
(and ability to communicate with) animals of its animal form. An
afflicted lycanthrope damaged in combat may be overwhelmed by rage,
causing it to change to its animal form involuntarily.</p>
      <p>A lycanthrope in animal form fights like the animal it
resembles, although its bite carries the disease of lycanthropy. It is
preternaturally cunning and strong, and possesses damage reduction that
is overcome only by silvered weapons.</p>
      <p>Finally, a natural lycanthrope (or an afflicted lycanthrope
that has become aware of its affliction) can assume a hybrid form that
is a mix of its humanoid and animal forms. A hybrid has hands and can
use weapons, but it can also attack with its teeth and claws. A hybrid
can spread lycanthropy with its bite, and it has the same damage
reduction that its animal form possesses.
