      <p>A trap usually either makes an attack roll or forces a saving
throw to avoid it. Occasionally a trap uses both of these options, or
neither (see Never Miss).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pits:</span> These are holes
(covered or not) that characters can fall into and take damage. A pit
needs no attack roll, but a successful Reflex save (DC set by the
builder) avoids it. Other save-dependent mechanical traps also fall
into this category.</p>
      <p>Pits in dungeons come in three basic varieties: uncovered,
covered, and chasms. Pits and chasms can be defeated by judicious
application of the Climb skill, the Jump skill, or various magical
means.</p>
      <p>Uncovered pits serve mainly to discourage intruders from going
a certain way, although they cause much grief to characters who stumble
into them in the dark, and they can greatly complicate a melee taking
place nearby.</p>
      <p>Covered pits are much more dangerous. They can be detected
with a DC 20 Search check, but only if the character is taking the time
to carefully examine the area before walking across it. A character who
fails to detect a covered pit is still entitled to a DC 20 Reflex save
to avoid falling into it. However, if she was running or moving
recklessly at the time, she gets no saving throw and falls
automatically.</p>
      <p>Trap coverings can be as simple as piled refuse (straw,
leaves, sticks, garbage), a large rug, or an actual trapdoor concealed
to appear as a normal part of the floor. Such a trapdoor usually swings
open when enough weight (usually about 50 to 80 pounds) is placed upon
it. Devious trap builders sometimes design trapdoors so that they
spring back shut after they open. The trapdoor might lock once
it&rsquo;s back in place, leaving the stranded character well and truly
trapped. Opening such a trapdoor is just as difficult as opening a
regular door (assuming the trapped character can reach it), and a DC 13
Strength check is needed to keep a spring-loaded door open.</p>
      <p>Pit traps often have something nastier than just a hard floor
at the bottom. A trap designer may put spikes, monsters, or a pool of
acid, lava, or even water at the bottom. Spikes at the bottom of a pit
deal damage as daggers with a +10 attack bonus and a +1 bonus on damage
for every 10 feet of the fall (to a maximum bonus on damage of +5). If
the pit has multiple spikes, a falling victim is attacked by 1d4 of
them. This damage is in addition to any damage from the fall
itself.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Monsters sometimes live in pits. Any monster that can fit into
the pit might have been placed there by the dungeon&rsquo;s designer,
or might simply have fallen in and not been able to climb back
out.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A secondary trap, mechanical or magical, at the bottom of a
pit can be particularly deadly. Activated by a falling victim, the
secondary trap attacks the already injured character when she&rsquo;s
least ready for it.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ranged Attack Traps:</span>
These traps fling darts, arrows, spears, or the like at whoever
activated the trap. The builder sets the attack bonus. A ranged attack
trap can be configured to simulate the effect of a composite bow with a
high strength rating which provides the trap with a bonus on damage
equal to its strength rating.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Melee Attack Traps:</span>
These traps feature such obstacles as sharp blades that emerge from
walls and stone blocks that fall from ceilings. Once again, the builder
sets the attack bonus.
