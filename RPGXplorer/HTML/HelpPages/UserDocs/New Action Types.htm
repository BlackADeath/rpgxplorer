      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Swift Action:</span> A swift
action consumes a very small amount of time, but represents a larger
expenditure of effort and energy than a free action. You can perform
one swift action per turn without affecting your ability to perform
other actions. In that regard, a swift action is like a free action.
However, you can perform only a single swift action per turn,
regardless of what other actions you take. You can take a swift action
any time you would normally be allowed to take a free action. Swift
actions usually involve psionics or the activation of psionic items;
many characters (especially those who don&rsquo;t use psionics) never
have an opportunity to take a swift action.</p>
      <p>Manifesting a quickened power is a swift action. In addition,
manifesting any power with a casting time of 1 swift action is a swift
action.</p>
      <p>Manifesting a power with a manifesting time of 1 swift action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immediate Action:</span> Much
like a swift action, an immediate action consumes a very small amount
of time, but represents a larger expenditure of effort and energy than
a free action. However, unlike a swift action, an immediate action can
be performed at any time - even if it&rsquo;s not your turn. Using an
immediate action on your turn is the same as using a swift action, and
counts as your swift action for that turn. You cannot use another
immediate action or a swift action until after your next turn if you
have used an immediate action when it is not currently your turn
(effectively, using an immediate action before your turn is equivalent
to using your swift action for the coming turn). You also cannot use an
immediate action if you are currently flat-footed.</p>
