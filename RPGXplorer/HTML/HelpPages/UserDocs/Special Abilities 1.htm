      <p>Psionic creatures can create psionic effects without having
levels in a psionic class (although they can take a psionic class to
further enhance their abilities); such creatures have the psionic
subtype.</p>
      <p>Characters using dorjes, <span style="font-style: italic;">cognizance crystals</span>,
and other psionic items can also create psionic effects. In addition to
existing spell-like and supernatural abilities, creatures can also have
psi-like abilities. (Psionic creatures may also have extraordinary and
natural abilities.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psi-Like Abilities (Ps):</span>
The manifestation of powers by a psionic character is considered a
psi-like ability, as is the manifestation of powers by creatures
without a psionic class (creatures with the psionic subtype, also
simply called psionic creatures). Usually, a psionic creature&rsquo;s
psi-like ability works just like the power of that name. A few psi-like
abilities are unique; these are explained in the text where they are
described.</p>
      <p>Psi-like abilities have no verbal, somatic, or material
components, nor do they require a focus or have an XP cost (even if the
equivalent power has an XP cost). The user activates them mentally.
Armor never affects a psi-like ability&rsquo;s use. A psi-like ability
has a manifesting time of 1 standard action unless noted otherwise in
the ability description. In all other ways, a psi-like ability
functions just like a power. However, a psionic creature does not have
to pay a psi-like ability&rsquo;s power point cost.</p>
      <p>Psi-like abilities are subject to power resistance and to being dispelled by <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>. They do not function in areas where psionics is suppressed or negated.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Supernatural Abilities:</span>
Some creatures have psionic abilities that are considered supernatural.
Psionic feats are also supernatural abilities. These abilities cannot
be disrupted in combat, as powers can be, and do not provoke attacks of
opportunity (except as noted in their descriptions). Supernatural
abilities are not subject to power resistance and cannot be negated or
dispelled; however, they do not function in areas where psionics is
suppressed.</p>
