      <p>A gaze special attack takes effect when opponents look at the
creature&rsquo;s eyes. The attack can have almost any sort of effect:
petrification, death, charm, and so on. The typical range is 30 feet,
but check the creature&rsquo;s entry for details. The type of saving
throw for a gaze attack varies, but it is usually a Will or Fortitude
save (DC 10 + 1/2 gazing creature&rsquo;s racial HD + gazing
creature&rsquo;s Cha modifier; the exact DC is given in the
creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). A successful saving throw negates
the effect. A monster&rsquo;s gaze attack is described in abbreviated
form in its description. Each opponent within range of a gaze attack
must attempt a saving throw each round at the beginning of his or her
turn in the initiative order. Only looking directly at a creature with
a gaze attack leaves an opponent vulnerable. Opponents can avoid the
need to make the saving throw by not looking at the creature, in one of
two ways.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Averting Eyes:</span> The
opponent avoids looking at the creature&rsquo;s face, instead looking
at its body, watching its shadow, tracking it in a reflective surface,
and so on. Each round, the opponent has a 50% chance to not need to
make a saving throw against the gaze attack. The creature with the gaze
attack, however, gains concealment against that opponent.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Wearing a Blindfold:</span>
The opponent cannot see the creature at all (also possible to achieve
by turning one&rsquo;s back on the creature or shutting one&rsquo;s
eyes). The creature with the gaze attack gains total concealment
against the opponent.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A creature with a gaze attack can actively gaze as an attack
action by choosing a target within range. That opponent must attempt a
saving throw but can try to avoid this as described above. Thus, it is
possible for an opponent to save against a creature&rsquo;s gaze twice
during the same round, once before the opponent&rsquo;s action and once
during the creature&rsquo;s turn.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Gaze attacks can affect ethereal opponents. A creature is immune to gaze attacks of others of its kind unless otherwise noted.</p>
      <p>Allies of a creature with a gaze attack might be affected. All
the creature&rsquo;s allies are considered to be averting their eyes
from the creature with the gaze attack, and have a 50% chance to not
need to make a saving throw against the gaze attack each round. The
creature also can veil its eyes, thus negating its gaze ability.
