      <p>Spectres, wraiths, and a few other creatures lack physical
bodies. Such creatures are insubstantial and can&rsquo;t be touched by
nonmagical matter or energy. Likewise, they cannot manipulate objects
or exert physical force on objects. However, incorporeal beings have a
tangible presence that sometimes seems like a physical attack against a
corporeal creature. </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures are present on the same plane as the
characters, and characters have some chance to affect them. </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures can be harmed only by other incorporeal
					  creatures, by magic weapons, or by spells, spell-like effects,
					  or supernatural effects. They are immune to all nonmagical
					    attack forms. They are not
					  burned by normal fires, affected by natural cold, or harmed
				  by mundane acids.</p>

					
      <p>Even when struck by magic or magic weapons, an incorporeal
					  creature has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a corporeal
					  source&mdash;except
				  for a force effect or damage dealt by a ghost touch weapon.</p>

					
					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures are immune to critical hits, extra
					    damage from being favored enemies, and from sneak attacks.
					    They move in any direction (including up or down) at
					      will. They do not need to walk
					    on the ground. They can pass through solid objects at
					      will, although they cannot see when their eyes are
					  within solid matter.<br>
      <br>

				      Incorporeal creatures hiding inside solid objects get
					      a +2 circumstance bonus on Listen checks, because solid
					      objects carry sound well. Pinpointing an opponent from inside
					      a solid object uses the same
					      rules as pinpointing invisible opponents (see Invisibility,
			      below). </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures are inaudible unless they decide to make
noise. </p>

					
      <p>The physical attacks of incorporeal creatures ignore
					          material armor, even magic armor, unless it is
					      made of force (such as mage armor or bracers of armor)
					          or has the ghost touch
		          ability. </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures pass through and operate in water as
easily as they do in air. </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures cannot fall or take falling
	              damage.</p>

					
      <p>Corporeal creatures cannot trip or grapple incorporeal
creatures. </p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures have no weight and
					                  do not set off traps that are triggered
			      by weight.</p>

					
      <p>Incorporeal creatures do not leave footprints,
					                    have no scent, and make no noise unless
					                    they manifest, and even then they only
					      make noise intentionally.<br>

			                                                                                      </p>
