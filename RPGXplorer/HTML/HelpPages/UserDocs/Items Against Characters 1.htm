      <p>When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own.
The item is, of course, absolutely true to its alignment. If the
character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment&rsquo;s
goals or the item&rsquo;s special purpose, personality conflict - item
against character - results. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of
20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a
personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree
with the item.</p>
      <p>When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a
Will saving throw (DC = item&rsquo;s Ego). If the possessor succeeds,
she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts
for one day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major
battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so
on). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character&rsquo;s
desires and demands concessions such as any of the following.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.</li>
        <li>The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.</li>
        <li>Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.</li>
        <li>Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.</li>
        <li>Magical protections and devices to protect the item from molestation when it is not in use.</li>
        <li>That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.</li>
        <li>That the character relinquish the item in favor of a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.</li>
      </ul>
In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following acts:
      <ul>
        <li>Force its possessor into combat.</li>
        <li>Refuse to strike opponents.</li>
        <li>Strike at its wielder or her associates.</li>
        <li>Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.</li>
        <li>Cause itself to drop from the character&rsquo;s grasp.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns
between the character&rsquo;s and item&rsquo;s alignments or when their
purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might
wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish
and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to
better accomplish its goals.</p>
      <p>All magic items with personalities desire to play an important
role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items
are rivals of each other, even if they are of the same alignment. No
intelligent item wants to share its wielder with others. An intelligent
item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60
feet, and most intelligent items try their best to mislead or distract
their host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course,
alignment might change this sort of behavior.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Items with personalities are never totally controlled or
silenced by the characters who possess them, even though they may never
successfully control their possessors. They may be powerless to force
their demands but remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and
demands.&nbsp;</p>
