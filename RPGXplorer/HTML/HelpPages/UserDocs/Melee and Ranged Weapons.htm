      <p>Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some
of them can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or
projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Reach Weapons:</span>
Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and
whips are reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows
its wielder to strike at targets that aren&rsquo;t adjacent to him or
her. Most reach double the wielder&rsquo;s natural reach, meaning that
a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a
creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A
typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size
can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or
creatures up to 10 feet away.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Double Weapons:</span> Dire
flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes,
quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character
can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two
weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties
associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were
wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.</p>
      <p>The character can also choose to use a double weapon two
handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double
weapon in one hand can&rsquo;t use it as a double weapon - only one end
of the weapon can be used in any given round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thrown Weapons:</span>
Daggers, clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes,
light hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The
wielder applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown
weapons (except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon
that isn&rsquo;t designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that
doesn&rsquo;t have a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on
Table: Weapons), but a character who does so takes a &ndash;4 penalty
on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard
action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action.
Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only
on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such
a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Projectile Weapons:</span>
Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite
shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating
crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two
hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no
Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless
it&rsquo;s a specially built composite shortbow, specially built
composite longbow, or sling. If the character has a penalty for low
Strength, apply it to damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ammunition:</span>
Projectile weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for
crossbows), or sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a
character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings
require an action for reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that
hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while normal
ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.</p>
      <p>Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as
ammunition for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or
otherwise special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what
happens to them after they are thrown.
