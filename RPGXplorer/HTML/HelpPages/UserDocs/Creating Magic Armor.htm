      <p>To create magic armor, a character needs a heat source and
some iron, wood, or leatherworking tools. He also needs a supply of
materials, the most obvious being the armor or the pieces of the armor
to be assembled. Armor to be made into magic armor must be masterwork
armor, and the masterwork cost is added to the base price to determine
final market value. Additional magic supplies costs for the materials
are subsumed in the cost for creating the magic armor - half the base
price of the item.</p>
      <p>Creating magic armor has a special prerequisite: The
creator&rsquo;s caster level must be at least three times the
enhancement bonus of the armor. If an item has both an enhancement
bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level
requirements must be met.</p>
      <p>Magic armor or a magic shield must have at least a +1
enhancement bonus to have any of the abilities listed on Table: Armor
Special Abilities and Table: Shield Special Abilities.</p>
      <p>If spells are involved in the prerequisites for making the
armor, the creator must have prepared the spells to be cast (or must
know the spells, in the case of a sorcerer or bard), must provide any
material components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP
costs required for the spells. The act of working on the armor triggers
the prepared spells, making them unavailable for casting during each
day of the armor&rsquo;s creation. (That is, those spell slots are
expended from his currently prepared spells, just as if they had been
cast.)</p>
      <p>Creating some armor may entail other prerequisites beyond or
other than spellcasting. See the individual descriptions for details.</p>
      <p>Crafting magic armor requires one day for each 1,000 gp value of the base price.</p>
