      <p>Psionic characters can learn new powers when they attain a new
level. A psion can learn any power from the psion/wilder list and
powers from his chosen discipline&rsquo;s list. A wilder can learn any
power from the psion/wilder list. A psychic warrior can learn any power
from the psychic warrior list. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Powers Gained at a New Level:</span>
Psions and other psionic characters perform a certain amount of
personal meditation between adventures in an attempt to unlock latent
mental abilities. Each time a psionic character attains a new level, he
or she learns additional powers according to his class description.
Psions, psychic warriors, and wilders learn new powers of their choice
in this fashion. These powers represent abilities unlocked from
latency. The powers must be of levels the characters can manifest.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Independent Research: </span>A
psion also can research a power independently, duplicating an existing
power or creating an entirely new one. If characters are allowed to
develop new powers, use these guidelines to handle the situation.</p>
      <p>Any kind of manifester can create a new power. The research
involved requires access to a retreat conducive to uninterrupted
meditation. Research involves an expenditure of 200 XP per week and
takes one week per level of the power. At the end of that time, the
character makes a Psicraft check (DC 10 + spell level). If that check
succeeds, the character learns the new power if her research produced a
viable power. If the check fails, the character must go through the
research process again if she wants to keep trying.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifest an Unknown Power from Another&rsquo;s Powers Known: </span>A
psionic character can attempt to manifest a power from a source other
than his own knowledge (usually a power stone or another willing
psionic character). To do so, the character must first make contact (a
process similar to addressing a power stone, requiring a Psicraft check
against a DC of 15+ the level of the power to be manifested). A psionic
character can make contact with only a willing psionic character or
creature (unconscious creatures are considered willing, but not psionic
characters under the effects of other immobilizing conditions).
Characters who can&rsquo;t use power stones for any reason are also
banned from attempting to manifest powers from the knowledge of other
psionic characters. Mental contact requires 1 full round of physical
contact, which can provoke attacks of opportunity. Once contact is
achieved, the character becomes aware of all the powers stored in the
power stone or all the powers the other character knows up to the
highest level of power the contactor knows himself. </p>
      <p>Next, the psionic character must choose one of the powers and
make a second Psicraft check (DC 15 + the power&rsquo;s level) to see
if he understands it. If the power is not on his class list, he
automatically fails this check.</p>
      <p>Upon successfully making contact with another willing psionic
character or creature and learning what he can of one power in
particular, the character can immediately attempt to manifest that
power even if he doesn&rsquo;t know it (and assuming he has power
points left for the day). He can attempt to manifest the power normally
on his next turn, and he succeeds if he makes one additional Psicraft
check (DC 15 + the power&rsquo;s level). He retains the ability to
manifest the selected power for only 1 round. If he doesn&rsquo;t
manifest the power, fails the Psicraft check, or manifests a different
power, he loses his chance to manifest that power for the day.</p>
