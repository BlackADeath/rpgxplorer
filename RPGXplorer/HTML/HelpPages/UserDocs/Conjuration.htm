      <p>Each conjuration spell belongs to one of five subschools.
Conjurations bring manifestations of objects, creatures, or some form
of energy to you (the summoning subschool), actually transport
creatures from another plane of existence to your plane (calling), heal
(healing), transport creatures or objects over great distances
(teleportation), or create objects or effects on the spot (creation).
Creatures you conjure usually, but not always, obey your commands.</p>
      <p>A creature or object brought into being or transported to your
location by a conjuration spell cannot appear inside another creature
or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty space. It must arrive
in an open location on a surface capable of supporting it.</p>
      <p>The creature or object must appear within the spell&rsquo;s range, but it does not have to remain within the range.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Calling:</span> A calling
spell transports a creature from another plane to the plane you are on.
The spell grants the creature the one-time ability to return to its
plane of origin, although the spell may limit the circumstances under
which this is possible. Creatures who are called actually die when they
are killed; they do not disappear and reform, as do those brought by a
summoning spell (see below). The duration of a calling spell is
instantaneous, which means that the called creature can&rsquo;t be
dispelled.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creation:</span> A creation
spell manipulates matter to create an object or creature in the place
the spellcaster designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the
spell has a duration other than instantaneous, magic holds the creation
together, and when the spell ends, the conjured creature or object
vanishes without a trace. If the spell has an instantaneous duration,
the created object or creature is merely assembled through magic. It
lasts indefinitely and does not depend on magic for its existence.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Healing:</span> Certain divine conjurations heal creatures or even bring them back to life.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Summoning:</span> A summoning
spell instantly brings a creature or object to a place you designate.
When the spell ends or is dispelled, a summoned creature is instantly
sent back to where it came from, but a summoned object is not sent back
unless the spell description specifically indicates this. A summoned
creature also goes away if it is killed or if its hit points drop to 0
or lower. It is not really dead. It takes 24 hours for the creature to
reform, during which time it can&rsquo;t be summoned again.</p>
      <p>When the spell that summoned a creature ends and the creature
disappears, all the spells it has cast expire. A summoned creature
cannot use any innate summoning abilities it may have, and it refuses
to cast any spells that would cost it XP, or to use any spell-like
abilities that would cost XP if they were spells.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Teleportation:</span> A
teleportation spell transports one or more creatures or objects a great
distance. The most powerful of these spells can cross planar
boundaries. Unlike summoning spells, the transportation is (unless
otherwise noted) one-way and not dispellable.</p>
      <p>Teleportation is instantaneous travel through the Astral Plane. Anything that blocks astral travel also blocks teleportation.
