      <p>Astral constructs are brought into being by the metacreativity
power astral construct. They are formed from raw ectoplasm (a portion
of the astral medium drawn into the Material Plane). The power points
spent by the construct&rsquo;s creator during the manifestation of the
power determine the level of the astral construct created. However,
even astral constructs of the same level vary somewhat from each other,
depending on the whims of their creators.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat:</span> Astral
constructs act as directed by their creators. As a free action, a
construct&rsquo;s manifester can direct the construct to attack
particular enemies, use specific tactics or powers, perform other
actions, or do nothing at all. The construct does exactly what its
creator directs it to do. </p>
      <p>An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of
ectoplasm with a vaguely humanoid shape, but the manifester can mold or
sculpt one according to his or her whim within the limits imposed by
the creature&rsquo;s size. The quality of such &ldquo;construct
sculpture&rdquo; is determined by a Craft (sculpting) check. A result
of 10 to 19 creates a creature that is recognizably similar to the
desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29 creates a construct that
looks like an accurate portrayal of that creature type; a result of 30
or higher creates a construct that looks like a specific individual. No
matter how high the Craft (sculpting) check result, though, an astral
construct&rsquo;s appearance can&rsquo;t hide the otherworldly material
from which it is formed.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Construct Traits:</span> An
astral construct has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning,
disease, death effects, necromancy effects, mind-affecting effects
(charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and morale effects), and any
effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on objects
or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal damage,
ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It
cannot heal damage, but it can be repaired.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Abilities:</span>
Every time an astral construct is created, the manifester can choose to
apply one special ability to the construct. When the manifester begins
to manifest the astral construct power, he chooses one or more special
abilities from a menu of abilities appropriate to that level of astral
construct.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creating an Astral Construct:</span>
When manifesting the astral construct power, the manifester assembles
the desired creature from a menu of choices, as specified in the
construct&rsquo;s statistics block. A manifester can always substitute
two choices from a lesser menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple
selections of the same menu choice do not stack unless the ability
specifically notes that stacking is allowed.</p>
      <p>Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to
manifest specific powers as psi-like abilities. Unless using the
ability is a free action, an astral construct manifesting such a power
does so as a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. All
such powers have a manifester level equal to the astral
construct&rsquo;s Hit Dice or the creator&rsquo;s manifester level,
whichever is lower.</p>
      <p>An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat granted by a menu choice. </p>
