      <p>While the medusa&rsquo;s gaze is well known, gaze attacks can
also charm, curse, or even kill. Gaze attacks not produced by a spell
are supernatural. </p>

					
      <p>Each character within range of a gaze attack must attempt a
saving throw (which can be a Fortitude or Will save) each round at the
beginning of his turn. </p>

					
      <p>An opponent can avert his eyes from the creature&rsquo;s face, looking
					  at the creature&rsquo;s body, watching its shadow, or tracking the creature
					  in a reflective surface. Each round, the opponent has a
					  50% chance of not having to make a saving throw. The creature with the
					  gaze attack gains
					  concealment relative to the opponent. An opponent can shut
					  his eyes, turn his back on the creature, or wear a blindfold. In these
					  cases, the opponent
					  does not need to make a saving throw. The creature with
					  the gaze attack gains total concealment relative to the opponent.</p>

					
      <p>A creature with a gaze attack can actively attempt to use
					  its gaze as an attack action. The creature simply chooses
					  a target within range, and that opponent must attempt a
					  saving throw. If the target has
					  chosen to defend against the gaze as discussed above, the
					  opponent gets a chance to avoid the saving throw (either
					  50% chance for averting eyes
					  or 100% chance for shutting eyes). It is possible for an
					  opponent to save against a creature&rsquo;s gaze twice during the same
					  round, once before its own action and once during the creature&rsquo;s
					  action.</p>
      <p>
					  Looking at the creature&rsquo;s image (such as in a mirror or as part
				  of an illusion) does not subject the viewer to a gaze attack.</p>

					
      <p>A creature is immune to its own gaze attack.</p>

					
      <p>If visibility is limited (by dim lighting, a fog, or the
					  like) so that it results in concealment, there is a percentage
					  chance equal to the normal miss chance for that degree
					  of concealment that a
					  character won&rsquo;t need to make a saving throw in a given round. This
					  chance is not cumulative with the chance for averting your
					  eyes, but is rolled separately.</p>

					
      <p>Invisible creatures cannot use gaze attacks.</p>

					
      <p>Characters using darkvision in complete darkness are affected
				  by a gaze attack normally.</p>

					
      <p>Unless specified otherwise, a creature with a gaze attack
					  can control its gaze attack and &ldquo;turn it off &rdquo; when so desired<br>
