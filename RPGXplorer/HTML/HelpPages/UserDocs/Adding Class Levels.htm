      <p>If you are advancing a monster by adding player character
class levels, decide if the class levels directly improve the
monster&rsquo;s existing capabilities.</p>
      <p>When adding class levels to a creature, you should give it
typical ability scores appropriate for that class. Most creatures are
built using the standard array of ability scores: 11, 11, 11, 10, 10,
10, adjusted by racial modifiers. If you give a creature a PC class use
the elite array of ability scores before racial adjustments: 15, 14,
13, 12, 10, 8. Creatures with NPC classes use the nonelite array of 13,
12, 11, 10, 9, 8. T</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Associated Class Levels: </span>Class
levels that increase a monster&rsquo;s existing strengths are known as
associated class levels. Each associated class level a monster has
increases its CR by 1.</p>
      <p>Barbarian, fighter, paladin, and ranger are associated classes for a creature that relies on its fighting ability.</p>
      <p>Rogue and ranger are associated classes for a creature that
relies on stealth to surprise its foes, or on skill use to give itself
an advantage. </p>
      <p>A spellcasting class is an associated class for a creature
that already has the ability to cast spells as a character of the class
in question, since the monster&rsquo;s levels in the spellcasting class
stack with its innate spellcasting ability.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nonassociated Class Levels:</span>
If you add a class level that doesn&rsquo;t directly play to a
creature&rsquo;s strength the class level is considered nonassociated,
and things get a little more complicated. Adding a nonassociated class
level to a monster increases its CR by 1/2 per level until one of its
nonassociated class levels equals its original Hit Dice. At that point,
each additional level of the same class or a similar one is considered
associated and increases the monster&rsquo;s CR by 1.</p>
      <p>Levels in NPC classes are always treated as nonassociated.</p>
