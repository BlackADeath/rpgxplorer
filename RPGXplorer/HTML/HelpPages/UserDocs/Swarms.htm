      <p>Swarms are dense masses of Fine, Diminutive, or Tiny creatures
that would not be particularly dangerous in small groups, but can be
terrible foes when gathered in sufficient numbers. For game purposes a
swarm is defined as a single creature with a space of 10
feet&mdash;gigantic hordes are actually composed of dozens of swarms in
close proximity. A swarm has a single pool of Hit Dice and hit points,
a single initiative modifier, a single speed, and a single Armor Class.
It makes saving throws as a single creature.</p>
      <p>Many different creatures can mass as swarms; bat swarms,
centipede swarms, hellwasp swarms, locust swarms, rat swarms, and
spider swarms are described here. The swarm&rsquo;s type varies with
the nature of the component creature (most are animals or vermin), but
all swarms have the swarm subtype.</p>
      <p>A swarm of Tiny creatures consists of 300 nonflying creatures
or 1,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Diminutive creatures consists of
1,500 nonflying creatures or 5,000 flying creatures. A swarm of Fine
creatures consists of 10,000 creatures, whether they are flying or not.
Swarms of nonflying creatures include many more creatures than could
normally fit in a 10-foot square based on their normal space, because
creatures in a swarm are packed tightly together and generally crawl
over each other and their prey when moving or attacking. Larger swarms
are represented by multiples of single swarms. A large swarm is
completely shapeable, though it usually remains contiguous.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat:</span> In order to
attack, a single swarm moves into opponents&rsquo; spaces, which
provokes an attack of opportunity. It can occupy the same space as a
creature of any size, since it crawls all over its prey, but remains a
creature with a 10-foot space. Swarms never make attacks of
opportunity, but they can provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p>Unlike other creatures with a 10-foot space, a swarm is
shapeable. It can occupy any four contiguous squares, and it can
squeeze through any space large enough to contain one of its component
creatures.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vulnerabilities of Swarms: </span>Swarms are extremely difficult to fight with physical attacks. However, they have a few special vulnerabilities, as follows:</p>
      <p>A lit torch swung as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of fire damage per hit.</p>
      <p>A weapon with a special ability such as flaming or frost deals
its full energy damage with each hit, even if the weapon&rsquo;s normal
damage can&rsquo;t affect the swarm.</p>
      <p>A lit lantern can be used as a thrown weapon, dealing 1d4
points of fire damage to all creatures in squares adjacent to where it
breaks.
