      <p>Inevitables are constructs whose sole aim is to enforce the natural laws of the universe.</p>
      <p>Each type of inevitable is designed to find and punish a
particular kind of transgression, hunting down a person or group that
has violated a fundamental principle. When an inevitable is created, it
receives its first mission, then finds the transgressors and metes out
appropriate punishment. The sentence is usually death, although some
inevitables insist on compensation to the wronged party instead, using <span style="font-style: italic;">geas </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">mark of justice</span>
to ensure compliance. From its first step, an inevitable focuses
totally on its target. It continues its efforts no matter how cold the
trail or hopeless the task. Inevitables are single-minded in pursuit of
their quarry, but they are under orders to leave innocents alone.
Accomplices to their prey are fair game, however, which sometimes
creates conflicts within their programming.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Inevitables gladly sacrifice themselves to complete a mission,
but they aren&rsquo;t suicidal. Faced with impending defeat, they are
likely to withdraw and seek a way to even the odds. They are determined
but patient foes. They ally with others if that helps accomplish their
mission, but they have a hard time keeping allies for long.</p>
      <p>Inevitables tend to stick out in a crowd while they&rsquo;re
in observation mode, but they seem oblivious to the attention. Their
forms vary, but all inevitables are gold-and-silver clockwork
creatures, with gears and pistons where muscles would be on
flesh-and-blood creatures. Their eyes glow with a golden radiance.</p>
      <p>Note that unlike most constructs, inevitables have an Intelligence score and can think, learn, and remember.</p>
      <p>Inevitables speak Abyssal, Celestial, Infernal, and the native language of their first target.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat:</span> Unless their
very existence is threatened, inevitables focus completely on the
transgressor they&rsquo;ve been assigned to, ignoring other combatants
completely. An inevitable might attack anyone who hinders its progress,
but it won&rsquo;t tarry beyond the point where it can reengage its
quarry. Inevitables take self-defense very seriously; anyone who
attacks an inevitable with what the creature perceives as deadly force
is met with deadly force in return.</p>
      <p>An inevitable&rsquo;s natural weapons, as well as any weapons
it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fast Healing (Ex):</span> An
inevitable heals a certain amount of damage each round (specified in
each variety&rsquo;s description) as long as it has at least 1 hit
point. However, damage dealt by chaotic weapons heals at the normal
rate.
