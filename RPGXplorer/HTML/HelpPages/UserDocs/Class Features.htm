      <p>Many, but not all, class features continue to accumulate after
20th level. The following guidelines describe how the epic class
progressions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A character&rsquo;s base save bonuses and base attack bonus
don&rsquo;t increase after 20th level. Use Table: Epic Save and Epic
Attack Bonuses to determine the character&rsquo;s epic bonus on saving
throws and attacks. </li>
        <li>Characters continue to gain Hit Dice and skill points as normal beyond 20th level.</li>
        <li>Generally, any class feature that uses class level as part
of a mathematical formula continues to increase using the
character&rsquo;s class level in the formula.&nbsp; Any prestige class
feature that calculates a save DC using the class level should add only
half the character&rsquo;s class levels above 10th. </li>
        <li>For spellcasters, caster level continues to increase after
20th level. However, spells per day don&rsquo;t increase after 20th
level. The only way to gain additional spells per day (other than the
bonus spells gained from a high ability score) is to select the
Improved Spell Capacity epic feat.</li>
        <li>The powers of familiars, special mounts, and fiendish servants continue to increase as their masters gain levels. </li>
        <li>Any class features that increase or accumulate as part of a
repeated pattern also continues to increase or accumulate after 20th
level at the same rate.&nbsp; An exception to this rule is any bonus
feat granted as a class feature. If a character gets bonus feats as
part of a class feature, these do not increase with epic levels.
Instead, these classes get bonus feats at a different rate (described
in each epic class description). </li>
        <li>In addition to the class features retained from nonepic
levels, each class gains a bonus feat every two, three, four, or five
levels after 20th. This augments each class&rsquo;s progression of
class features, because not all classes otherwise improve class
features after 20th level. A character must select these feats from the
list of bonus feats for that class. These bonus feats are in addition
to the feat that every character gets every three levels. The character
isn&rsquo;t limited to selecting from the class list when selecting
these feats. </li>
        <li>Characters don&rsquo;t gain any new class features, because
there aren&rsquo;t any new class features described for these levels.
Class features with a progression that slows or stops before 20th level
and features that have a limited list of options do not improve as a
character gains epic levels. Likewise, class features that are gained
only at a single level do not improve.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding a Second Class:</span>
When a single-class epic character gains a level, he or she may choose
to increase the level of his or her current class or pick up a new
class at 1st level. The standard rules for multiclass characters still
apply, but epic characters must keep in mind the rules for epic
advancement. The epic character gains all the 1st-level class skills,
weapon proficiency, armor proficiency, spells, and other class features
of the new class, as well as a Hit Die of the appropriate type. In
addition, the character gets the usual skill points from the new class.
Just as with standard multiclassing, adding the second class does not
confer some of the benefits for a 1st-level character, including
maximum hit points from the first Hit Die, quadruple the per-level
skill points, starting equipment, starting gold, or an animal
companion. An epic character does not gain the base attack bonuses and
base save bonuses normally gained when adding a second class. Instead,
an epic character uses the epic attack bonus and epic save bonus
progression shown on Table: Epic Save and Epic Attack Bonus.</p>
