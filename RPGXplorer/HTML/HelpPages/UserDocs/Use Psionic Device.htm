      <p><strong></strong>Use this skill to activate psionic devices,
including power stones (chunks of crystal that store specific powers)
and&nbsp; dorjes (slender crystal wands charged with several uses of
the same power), that otherwise you could not activate.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Check:</span> You can use
this skill to address a power stone (to learn what powers are encoded
on it) or to activate a psionic item. This skill lets you use a psionic
item as if you had the manifesting ability or class features of another
class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were a different
alignment.</p>
      <p>You make Use Psionic Device checks each time you activate a
device such as a dorje. If you are using the check to emulate an
alignment or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make
the relevant emulation checks once per hour.</p>
      <p>You must consciously choose what to emulate. That is, you must
know what you are trying to emulate when you make an emulation check.
The DCs for various tasks involving Use Psionic Device are summarized
on the table below.</p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Activate Blindly:</span>
Some psionic items are activated by special specific thoughts or
conceptions. You can activate such items as if you were using the
activation method, even if you&rsquo;re not and even if you don&rsquo;t
know it. You do have to use something equivalent. You have to wave the
item around or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a
special +2 bonus if you&rsquo;ve activated the item at least once
before.</p>
      <p>If you fail the check by 10 or more, you suffer brainburn.
This brainburn affects you in the same way as brainburn that can occur
when you attempt to manifest a power from a power stone, except that
the damage is 1d4 points per power level instead of 1d6. Brainburn
damage from activating blindly is in addition to brainburn damage from
manifesting a power from a power stone.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Address a Power Stone:</span>
Successfully addressing a power stone allows you to find out what power
or powers it contains. Doing this requires 1 minute of concentration.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Emulate an Ability Score:</span>
To manifest a power from a power stone, you need a high ability score
in the appropriate ability. Your effective ability score (appropriate
to the class you&rsquo;re emulating when you try to manifest the power
from the power stone) is your check result minus 15. If you already
have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don&rsquo;t
need to make this check.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Emulate an Alignment:</span>
Some psionic items have positive or negative effects based on your
alignment. Use Psionic Device lets you use these items as if you were
of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a
time. </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Emulate a Class Feature:</span>
Sometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a psionic item.
Your effective level in the emulated class equals your check result
minus 20. This skill does not let you use the class feature of another
class. It just lets you activate items as if you had the class feature.</p>
      <p>If the class whose feature you are emulating has an alignment
requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an
appropriate alignment as a separate check (see above).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Emulate a Race:</span> Some
psionic items work only for certain races, or work better for those of
certain races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your
choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Use a Dorje:</span>
Normally, to use a dorje, you must have the dorje&rsquo;s power on your
class power list. This use of the skill allows you to use a dorje as if
you had a particular power on your class power list. This use of the
skill applies to other power trigger psionic items, if applicable.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Use a Power Stone:</span>
Normally, to manifest a power from a power stone, you must have the
power stone&rsquo;s power on your class power list. This use of the
skill allows you to use a power stone as if you had a particular power
on your class power list. The DC is equal to 20 + the manifester level
of the power you are trying to manifest from the power stone. <span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span>
Before you use a power stone, you must first have addressed it to
determine what powers it contains. In addition, manifesting a power
from a power stone requires a minimum score (10 + power level) in the
appropriate ability. If you don&rsquo;t have a high enough score, you
must emulate the ability score with a separate check (see above). This
use of the skill applies to other power completion psionic items.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Action:</span> None. The Use Psionic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the psionic item.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Try Again:</span> Yes, but if
you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you
fail, you can&rsquo;t try to activate it again for a day.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> You cannot take 10 with this skill.</p>
      <p>You can&rsquo;t aid another on Use Psionic Device checks. Only the user of the item can attempt such a check.</p>
      <p>A character with the Psionic Affinity feat gets a +2 bonus on Use Psionic Device checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Synergy:</span> If you have 5 or more ranks in Psicraft, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to power stones.</p>
      <p>If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Psionic Device, you get a +2 bonus on Psicraft checks to address power stones.</p>
