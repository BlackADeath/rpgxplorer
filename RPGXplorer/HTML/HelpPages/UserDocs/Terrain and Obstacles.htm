      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficult Terrain:</span>
Difficult terrain hampers movement. Each square of difficult terrain
counts as 2 squares of movement. (Each diagonal move into a difficult
terrain square counts as 3 squares.) You can&rsquo;t run or charge
across difficult terrain.</p>
      <p>If you occupy squares with different kinds of terrain, you can
move only as fast as the most difficult terrain you occupy will allow.</p>
      <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures are not hampered by difficult terrain.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Obstacles:</span> Like
difficult terrain, obstacles can hamper movement. If an obstacle
hampers movement but doesn&rsquo;t completely block it each obstructed
square or obstacle between squares counts as 2 squares of movement. You
must pay this cost to cross the barrier, in addition to the cost to
move into the square on the other side. If you don&rsquo;t have
sufficient movement to cross the barrier and move into the square on
the other side, you can&rsquo;t cross the barrier. Some obstacles may
also require a skill check to cross.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, some obstacles block movement entirely. A character can&rsquo;t move through a blocking obstacle.</p>
      <p>Flying and incorporeal creatures can avoid most obstacles</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Squeezing: </span>In some
cases, you may have to squeeze into or through an area that isn&rsquo;t
as wide as the space you take up. You can squeeze through or into a
space that is at least half as wide as your normal space. Each move
into or through a narrow space counts as if it were 2 squares, and
while squeezed in a narrow space you take a &ndash;4 penalty on attack
rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to AC.</p>
      <p>When a Large creature (which normally takes up four squares)
squeezes into a space that&rsquo;s one square wide, the
creature&rsquo;s miniature figure occupies two squares, centered on the
line between the two squares. For a bigger creature, center the
creature likewise in the area it squeezes into.</p>
      <p>A creature can squeeze past an opponent while moving but it can&rsquo;t end its movement in an occupied square.</p>
      <p>To squeeze through or into a space less than half your
space&rsquo;s width, you must use the Escape Artist skill. You
can&rsquo;t attack while using Escape Artist to squeeze through or into
a narrow space, you take a &ndash;4 penalty to AC, and you lose any
Dexterity bonus to AC.&nbsp;</p>
