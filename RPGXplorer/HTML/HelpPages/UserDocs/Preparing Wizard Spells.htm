      <p>A wizard&rsquo;s level limits the number of spells she can
prepare and cast. Her high Intelligence score might allow her to
prepare a few extra spells. She can prepare the same spell more than
once, but each preparation counts as one spell toward her daily limit.
To prepare a spell the wizard must have an Intelligence score of at
least 10 + the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rest:</span> To prepare her
daily spells, a wizard must first sleep for 8 hours. The wizard does
not have to slumber for every minute of the time, but she must refrain
from movement, combat, spellcasting, skill use, conversation, or any
other fairly demanding physical or mental task during the rest period.
If her rest is interrupted, each interruption adds 1 hour to the total
amount of time she has to rest in order to clear her mind, and she must
have at least 1 hour of uninterrupted rest immediately prior to
preparing her spells. If the character does not need to sleep for some
reason, she still must have 8 hours of restful calm before preparing
any spells.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Recent Casting Limit/Rest Interruptions:</span>
If a wizard has cast spells recently, the drain on her resources
reduces her capacity to prepare new spells. When she prepares spells
for the coming day, all the spells she has cast within the last 8 hours
count against her daily limit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation Environment:</span>
To prepare any spell, a wizard must have enough peace, quiet, and
comfort to allow for proper concentration. The wizard&rsquo;s
surroundings need not be luxurious, but they must be free from overt
distractions. Exposure to inclement weather prevents the necessary
concentration, as does any injury or failed saving throw the character
might experience while studying. Wizards also must have access to their
spellbooks to study from and sufficient light to read them by. There is
one major exception: A wizard can prepare a <span style="font-style: italic;">read magic</span> spell even without a spellbook.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Preparation Time:</span>
After resting, a wizard must study her spellbook to prepare any spells
that day. If she wants to prepare all her spells, the process takes 1
hour. Preparing some smaller portion of her daily capacity takes a
proportionally smaller amount of time, but always at least 15 minutes,
the minimum time required to achieve the proper mental state.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Selection and Preparation:</span>
Until she prepares spells from her spellbook, the only spells a wizard
has available to cast are the ones that she already had prepared from
the previous day and has not yet used. During the study period, she
chooses which spells to prepare. If a wizard already has spells
prepared (from the previous day) that she has not cast, she can abandon
some or all of them to make room for new spells.</p>
      <p>When preparing spells for the day, a wizard can leave some of
these spell slots open. Later during that day, she can repeat the
preparation process as often as she likes, time and circumstances
permitting. During these extra sessions of preparation, the wizard can
fill these unused spell slots. She cannot, however, abandon a
previously prepared spell to replace it with another one or fill a slot
that is empty because she has cast a spell in the meantime. That sort
of preparation requires a mind fresh from rest. Like the first session
of the day, this preparation takes at least 15 minutes, and it takes
longer if the wizard prepares more than one-quarter of her spells.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Slots:</span> The
various character class tables show how many spells of each level a
character can cast per day. These openings for daily spells are called
spell slots. A spellcaster always has the option to fill a higher-level
spell slot with a lower-level spell. A spellcaster who lacks a high
enough ability score to cast spells that would otherwise be his or her
due still gets the slots but must fill them with spells of lower level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prepared Spell Retention:</span>
Once a wizard prepares a spell, it remains in her mind as a nearly cast
spell until she uses the prescribed components to complete and trigger
it or until she abandons it. Certain other events, such as the effects
of magic items or special attacks from monsters, can wipe a prepared
spell from a character&rsquo;s mind.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Death and Prepared Spell Retention:</span> If a spellcaster dies, all prepared spells stored in his or her mind are wiped away. Potent magic (such as <span style="font-style: italic;">raise dead, resurrection,</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">true resurrection</span>) can recover the lost energy when it recovers the character.
