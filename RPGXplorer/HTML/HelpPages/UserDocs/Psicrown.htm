      <p>A psicrown is a special headband that stores several powers.
Unlike dorjes, which can contain a wide variety of powers, each
psicrown is of a certain kind and holds specific powers. Unless
otherwise stated, a psicrown has power points equal to 50 x its
manifester level when created. These power points can be spent only on
the powers that are contained in the psicrown.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical psicrown is large enough to fit on the head of a Medium
creature. Some psicrowns are actually crownlike and heavily adorned,
while others are simple headbands with crystal centerpieces. All
psicrowns weigh less than 1 pound. Most psicrowns are metallic, but one
could potentially be composed of any material. Metallic psicrowns have
AC 10, 10 hit points, hardness 8, and a break DC of 28. Psicrowns made
of psionically reinforced silk have AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 2,
and a break DC of 24. Psicrowns can be made from other, more exotic
materials, but all have at least the strength and durability of
psicrowns made of psionically reinforced silk.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Psicrowns
use the power trigger activation method, so manifesting a power from a
psicrown is usually a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. (If the power being manifested, however, has a longer
manifesting time than 1 standard action, it takes that long to manifest
the power from a psicrown.) When activating a psicrown, the user spends
power points contained in the psicrown on any one of the
psicrown&rsquo;s powers. Powers activated from a psicrown can be
augmented with additional power points from the psicrown itself, so
long as the total number of power points spent does not exceed the
user&rsquo;s manifester level. The user can&rsquo;t manifest a power
from a psicrown using his own power points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Psicrown Descriptions:</span>
Psicrowns have immense utility because they pack so many capabilities
into one item and because they use the wearer&rsquo;s ability score and
relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their powers.</p>
      <p>Unlike with other sorts of psionic items, the wearer can use
his manifester level when activating the power of a psicrown if
it&rsquo;s higher than the manifester level of the psicrown. <br>
The minimum manifester level of a psicrown is 8th. The manifester level
of a psicrown cannot be more than five levels higher than the minimum
manifester level for the highest-level power in the psicrown. Standard
psicrowns are described below.</p>
