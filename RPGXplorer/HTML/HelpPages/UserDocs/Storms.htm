      <p>The combined effects of precipitation (or dust) and wind that
accompany all storms reduce visibility ranges by three quarters,
imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks. Storms make
ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons,
which have a -4 penalty on attack rolls. They automatically extinguish
candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected
flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50%
chance to extinguish these lights. See Table: Wind Effects for possible
consequences to creatures caught outside without shelter during such a
storm. Storms are divided into the following three types.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Duststorm (CR 3):</span>
These desert storms differ from other storms in that they have no
precipitation. Instead, a duststorm blows fine grains of sand that
obscure vision, smother unprotected flames, and can even choke
protected flames (50% chance). Most duststorms are accompanied by
severe winds and leave behind a deposit of 1d6 inches of sand. However,
there is a 10% chance for a greater duststorm to be accompanied by
windstorm-magnitude winds (see Table: Wind Effects). These greater
duststorms deal 1d3 points of nonlethal damage each round to anyone
caught out in the open without shelter and also pose a choking hazard
(see Drowning-except that a character with a scarf or similar
protection across her mouth and nose does not begin to choke until
after a number of rounds equal to 10 &times; her Constitution score).
Greater duststorms leave 2d3-1 feet of fine sand in their wake.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Snowstorm:</span> In
addition to the wind and precipitation common to other storms,
snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Thunderstorm:</span> In
addition to wind and precipitation (usually rain, but sometimes also
hail), thunderstorms are accompanied by lightning that can pose a
hazard to characters without proper shelter (especially those in metal
armor). As a rule of thumb, assume one bolt per minute for a 1-hour
period at the center of the storm. Each bolt causes electricity damage
equal to 1d10 eight-sided dice. One in ten thunderstorms is accompanied
by a tornado (see below).&nbsp;
