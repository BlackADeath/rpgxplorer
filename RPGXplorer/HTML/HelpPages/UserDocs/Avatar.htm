      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Prerequisites:</span> Divine rank 6, Cha 29.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Benefit:</span> An avatar
serves as a deity&rsquo;s alter ego, effectively allowing the deity to
be in two or more places at the same time. An avatar is an extension of
a deity. The deity senses and knows everything the avatar senses and
knows and vice versa. Each avatar counts as a remote location where the
deity is sensing and communicating. A lesser deity can have up to five
avatars at once, an intermediate deity can have up to ten, and a
greater deity can have up to twenty avatars at once. It takes a deity
one year to create an avatar or replace a destroyed avatar. The process
does not require any special effort on the deity&rsquo;s part. An
avatar must be created in the deity&rsquo;s own realm. If the deity has
the Divine Creation salient divine ability, the deity can use it to
create a new avatar anywhere. However, the deity must rest afterward as
noted in the Divine Creation ability description. An avatar is a less
powerful version of a deity, created by modifying the deity&rsquo;s
statistics, that has the following characteristics.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Divine Rank:</span> The
avatar&rsquo;s divine rank is half that of the deity (round down). This
decrease in divine rank affects many of the avatar&rsquo;s statistics
and abilities, including bonuses to attack rolls, damage, saves,
checks, and Armor Class, damage reduction, resistances, number of
salient divine abilities and bonus salient divine abilities, uses per
day of domain powers, saving throw DCs against spell-like abilities,
range of senses, automatic actions, magic items it can create, and
extent of divine aura. The deity&rsquo;s ability scores, speed, class
levels, and Hit Dice are unchanged.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Divine Abilities:</span> The
avatar has salient divine abilities according to its own divine rank.
The deity chooses which of its abilities the avatar has when creating
the avatar. The avatar cannot have a salient divine ability that is not
available to a deity of its own rank, nor can it use a salient divine
ability if it doesn&rsquo;t meet the prerequisites. An avatar cannot
have the Avatar or Possess Mortal salient divine abilities.</p>
      <p>An avatar does not have any remote sensing or remote communication powers.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Suggested Portfolio Elements:</span> Any.&nbsp;</p>
