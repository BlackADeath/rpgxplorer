      <p>Psionic tattoos are designs scribed on the skin that manifest
powers on their wearers. The wearer doesn&rsquo;t get to make any
decisions about the tattoo&rsquo;s effect - the manifester who scribed
it has already done so.</p>
      <p>Psionic tattoos can vary in size, but a creature can wear only
a total of twenty tattoos at one time - attempting to add one more than
this maximum causes all previously scribed tattoos to simultaneously
activate. A psionic tattoo fades away after use.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical psionic tattoo is a colorful pattern of tiny, interlacing
lines within a larger design. This design can be as simple as a circle
or a star, or as complex as an artist wishes to make it. Once it is
scribed, a tattoo&rsquo;s design does not change. A psionic tattoo
usually covers an area of skin no more than 5 inches in diameter
(larger ones could be designed, but would have no added effect).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scribing and Transferring Tattoos:</span>
The manifester level of a psionic tattoo is the minimum level required
to manifest the scribed power. A psionic tattoo can contain only powers
of 3rd level or lower.</p>
      <p>A psionic tattoo inscribed on a wearer is potentially more
mobile than a mundane tattoo. As a standard action, the wearer can will
the tattoo to move to a different part of his body or onto the skin of
any willing (or unconscious) living creature he touches. If the wearer
of a psionic tattoo is rendered unconscious or is slain, another
sentient creature can touch the tattoo while willing it to leave the
previous wearer and apply itself to the new creature as a standard
action. Psionic tattoos cannot overlay one another.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying Psionic Tattoos:</span>
In addition to the standard methods of identification, the wearer of a
tattoo can concentrate on it and attempt to gain some sense of how it
would feel if activated. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check provides
a hint to the tattoo&rsquo;s effect. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> A psionic
tattoo produces its effect when touched by its wearer and willed to do
so. This activity, called &ldquo;tapping&rdquo; the tattoo, is a
standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A psionic tattoo
fades away after use.</p>
      <p>The following rules govern the use of psionic tattoos.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A creature must have an appropriate physical surface on
which to scribe the pattern (thus, incorporeal creatures or creatures
with impermanent flesh, such as fire elementals, cannot use psionic
tattoos).</li>
        <li>Tapping a psionic tattoo provokes attacks of opportunity. A
successful attack (including grappling attacks) against the wearer
forces a Concentration check. A wearer who fails this check cannot
concentrate effectively on the tattoo to use it. The tattoo remains
untapped, and the wearer can make another attempt.</li>
        <li>A character can trigger the effects of another&rsquo;s
psionic tattoo if the other wearer is unconscious. It is a full-round
action to find, touch, and concentrate on an unconscious
creature&rsquo;s tattoo in order to tap it. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The manifester level for a standard psionic tattoo is the
minimum manifester level needed to manifest the power (unless otherwise
specified).</p>
