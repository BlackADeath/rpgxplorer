      <p>Most campfire sparks ignite nothing, but if conditions are
dry, winds are strong, or the forest floor is dried out and flammable,
a forest fire can result. Lightning strikes often set trees afire and
start forest fires in this way. Whatever the cause of the fire,
travelers can get caught in the conflagration.</p>
      <p>A forest fire can be spotted from as far away as 2d6&times;100
feet by a character who makes a Spot check, treating the fire as a
Colossal creature (reducing the DC by 16). If all characters fail their
Spot checks, the fire moves closer to them. They automatically see it
when it closes to half the original distance.</p>
      <p>Characters who are blinded or otherwise unable to make Spot
checks can feel the heat of the fire (and thus automatically
&ldquo;spot&rdquo; it) when it is 100 feet away.</p>
      <p>The leading edge of a fire (the downwind side) can advance
faster than a human can run (assume 120 feet per round for winds of
moderate strength). Once a particular portion of the forest is ablaze,
it remains so for 2d4&times;10 minutes before dying to a smoking
smolder. Characters overtaken by a forest fire may find the leading
edge of the fire advancing away from them faster than they can keep up,
trapping them deeper and deeper in its grasp.</p>
      <p>Within the bounds of a forest fire, a character faces three dangers: heat damage, catching on fire, and smoke inhalation.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Heat Damage:</span> Getting
caught within a forest fire is even worse than being exposed to extreme
heat (see Heat Dangers). Breathing the air causes a character to take
1d6 points of damage per round (no save). In addition, a character must
make a Fortitude save every 5 rounds (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or
take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. A character who holds his breath
can avoid the lethal damage, but not the nonlethal damage. Those
wearing heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their
saving throws. In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into
contact with very hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Catching on Fire:</span>
Characters engulfed in a forest fire are at risk of catching on fire
when the leading edge of the fire overtakes them, and are then at risk
once per minute thereafter (see Catching on Fire).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Smoke Inhalation:</span>
Forest fires naturally produce a great deal of smoke. A character who
breathes heavy smoke must make a Fortitude save each round (DC 15, +1
per previous check) or spend that round choking and coughing. A
character who chokes for 2 consecutive rounds takes 1d6 points of
nonlethal damage. Also, smoke obscures vision, providing concealment to
characters within it.
