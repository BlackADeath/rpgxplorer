      <p>Golems are magically created automatons of great power.
Constructing one involves the employment of mighty magic and elemental
forces.</p>
      <p>The animating force for a golem is a spirit from the Elemental
Plane of Earth. The process of creating the golem binds the unwilling
spirit to the artificial body and subjects it to the will of the
golem&rsquo;s creator.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Combat:</span> Golems are
tenacious in combat and prodigiously strong as well. Being mindless,
they do nothing without orders from their creators. They follow
instructions explicitly and are incapable of any strategy or tactics.
They are emotionless in combat and cannot be provoked.</p>
      <p>A golem&rsquo;s creator can command it if the golem is within
60 feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a golem
usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though
if attacked it returns the attack. The creator can give the golem a
simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence. The
golem&rsquo;s creator can order the golem to obey the commands of
another person (who might in turn place the golem under someone
else&rsquo;s control, and so on), but the golem&rsquo;s creator can
always resume control over his creation by commanding the golem to obey
him alone.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immunity to Magic (Ex): </span>Golems have immunity to most magical and supernatural effects, except when otherwise noted.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Construction:</span> The cost
to create given for each golem includes the cost of the physical body
and all the materials and spell components that are consumed or become
a permanent part of the golem. Creating a golem is essentially similar
to creating any sort of magic item. However, a golem&rsquo;s body
includes costly material components that may require some extra
preparation. The golem&rsquo;s creator can assemble the body or hire
someone else to do the job. The builder must have the appropriate
skill, which varies with the golem variety.</p>
      <p>Completing the golem&rsquo;s creation drains the appropriate
XP from the creator and requires casting any spells on the final day.</p>
      <p>The creator must cast the spells personally, but they can come from outside sources, such as scrolls.</p>
      <p>The characteristics of a golem that come from its nature as a
magic item (caster level, prerequisite feats and spells, market price,
cost to create) are given in summary form at the end of each
golem&rsquo;s description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note:</span> The market
price of an advanced golem (a golem with more Hit Dice than the typical
golem described in each entry) is increased by 5,000 gp for each
additional Hit Die, and increased by an additional 50,000 gp if the
golem&rsquo;s size increases. The XP cost for creating an advanced
golem is equal to 1/25 the advanced golem&rsquo;s market price minus
the cost of the special materials required.
