      <p>Each monster description is organized in the same general format, as outlined below.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Statistics Block: </span>This portion of a monster description contains basic game information on the creature.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Name: </span>This is the name by which the creature is generally known. The descriptive text may provide other names.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size and Type:</span> This
line describes the creature&rsquo;s size. A size modifier applies to
the creature&rsquo;s Armor Class (AC) and attack bonus, as well as to
certain skills. A creature&rsquo;s size also determines how far it can
reach to make a melee attack and how much space it occupies in a fight
(see Space/Reach, below).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The size and type line continues with the creature&rsquo;s
type. Type determines how magic affects a creature. Type determines
certain features, such as Hit Dice size, base attack bonus, base saving
throw bonuses, and skill points.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Dice:</span> This line
gives the creature&rsquo;s number and type of Hit Dice, and lists any
bonus hit points. A parenthetical note gives the average hit points for
a creature of the indicated number of Hit Dice. A creature&rsquo;s Hit
Dice total is also treated as its level for determining how spells
affect the creature, its rate of natural healing, and its maximum ranks
in a skill.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initiative:</span> This line gives the creature&rsquo;s modifier on initiative checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> This line gives
the creature&rsquo;s tactical speed on land (the amount of distance it
can cover in one move action). If the creature wears armor that reduces
its speed, the creature&rsquo;s base land speed follows.</p>
      <p>If the creature has other modes of movement, these are given
after (or in place of) the land speed. Unless noted otherwise, modes of
movement are natural (not magical).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> The Armor
Class line gives the creature&rsquo;s AC for normal combat and includes
a parenthetical mention of the modifiers contributing to it (usually
size, Dexterity, and natural armor). The creature&rsquo;s touch and
flat-footed ACs follow the combat-ready AC.</p>
      <p>A creature&rsquo;s armor proficiencies (if it has any) depend
on its type, but in general a creature is automatically proficient with
any kind of armor it is described as wearing (light, medium, or heavy),
and with all lighter kinds of armor.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Base Attack/Grapple: </span>The
number before the slash on this line is the creature&rsquo;s base
attack bonus (before any modifiers are applied). This number
won&rsquo;t often be used, but it can be handy sometimes, especially if
the creature has the Power Attack or Combat Expertise feats.</p>
      <p>The number after the slash is the creature&rsquo;s grapple
bonus, which is used when the creature makes a grapple attack or when
someone tries to grapple the creature. The grapple bonus includes all
modifiers that apply to the creature&rsquo;s grapple checks (base
attack bonus, Strength modifier, special size modifier, and any other
applicable modifier, such as a racial bonus on grapple checks).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attack:</span> This line
shows the single attack the creature makes with an attack action. In
most cases, this is also the attack the creature uses when making an
attack of opportunity as well. The attack line provides the weapon used
(natural or manufactured), attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or
ranged). The attack bonus given includes modifications for size and
Strength (for melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A
creature with the Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on
melee attacks. If the creature uses natural attacks, the natural weapon
given here is the creature&rsquo;s primary natural weapon. If the
creature has several different weapons at its disposal, the
alternatives are shown, with each different attack separated by the
word &ldquo;or.&rdquo; A creature can use one of its secondary natural
weapons when making an attack action, but if it does it takes an attack
penalty, as noted in the Full Attack section below. The damage that
each attack deals is noted parenthetically. Damage from an attack is
always at least 1 point, even if a subtraction from a die roll reduces
the result to 0 or lower.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Attack:</span> This line
shows all the physical attacks the creature makes when it uses a
full-round action to make a full attack. It gives the number of attacks
along with the weapon, attack bonus, and form of attack (melee or
ranged). The first entry is for the creature&rsquo;s primary weapon,
with an attack bonus including modifications for size and Strength (for
melee attacks) or Dexterity (for ranged attacks). A creature with the
Weapon Finesse feat can use its Dexterity modifier on melee attacks.
The remaining weapons are secondary, and attacks with them are made
with a &ndash;5 penalty to the attack roll, no matter how many there
are. Creatures with the Multiattack feat take only a &ndash;2 penalty
on secondary attacks. The damage that each attack deals is noted
parenthetically. Damage from an attack is always at least 1 point, even
if a subtraction from a die roll reduces the result to 0 or lower.</p>
      <p>A creature&rsquo;s primary attack damage includes its full
Strength modifier (1-1/2 times its Strength bonus if the attack is with
the creature&rsquo;s sole natural weapon) and is given first. Secondary
attacks add only 1/2 the creature&rsquo;s Strength bonus and are given
second in the parentheses.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If any attacks also have some special effect other than damage, that information is given here.</p>
      <p>Unless noted otherwise, creatures using natural weapons deal double damage on critical hits.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Manufactured Weapons:</span>
Creatures that use swords, bows, spears, and the like follow the same
rules as characters do. The bonus for attacks with two-handed weapons
is 1-1/2 times the creature&rsquo;s Strength modifier (if it is a
bonus), and is given first. Offhand weapons add only 1/2 the Strength
bonus and are given second in the parentheses.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space/Reach:</span> This line
describes how much space the creature takes up on the battle grid and
thereby needs to fight effectively, as well as how close it has to be
to threaten an opponent. The number before the slash is the
creature&rsquo;s space, or how many feet one side of the creature
occupies. The number after the slash is the creature&rsquo;s natural
reach. If the creature has exceptional reach due to a weapon, tentacle,
or the like, the extended reach and its source are noted in parentheses
at the end of the line.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Attacks and Special Qualities:</span>
Many creatures have unusual abilities. A monster entry breaks these
abilities into special attacks and special qualities. The latter
category includes defenses, vulnerabilities, and other special
abilities that are not modes of attack. A special ability is either
extraordinary (Ex), spell-like (Sp), or supernatural (Su). Additional
information (when needed) is provided in the creature&rsquo;s
descriptive text.</p>
      <p>When a special ability allows a saving throw, the kind of save
and the save DC is noted in the descriptive text. Most saving throws
against special abilities have DCs calculated as follows: 10 + 1/2 the
attacker&rsquo;s racial Hit Dice + the relevant ability modifier.</p>
      <p>The save DC is given in the creature&rsquo;s description along with the ability on which the DC is based.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Saves:</span> This line gives the creature&rsquo;s Fortitude, Reflex, and Will save modifiers.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Abilities:</span> This line
lists the creature&rsquo;s ability scores, in the customary order: Str,
Dex, Con, Int, Wis, Cha. Except where noted otherwise, each creature is
assumed to have the standard array of ability scores before racial
adjustments (all 11s and 10s). To determine any creature&rsquo;s racial
ability adjustments, subtract 10 from any even-numbered ability score
and subtract 11 from any odd-numbered score. (Exceptions are noted in
the Combat section of a creature&rsquo;s descriptive text.)&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Strength:</span> Quadrupeds
can carry heavier loads than bipeds can. Any creature with four or more
motive limbs can carry a load as a quadruped, even if it does not
necessarily use all the limbs at once.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Intelligence: </span>A
creature can speak all the languages mentioned in its description, plus
one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Any creature
with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher understands at least one
language (Common, unless noted otherwise).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Nonabilities:</span> Some
creatures lack certain ability scores. These creatures do not have an
ability score of 0&mdash;they lack the ability altogether. The modifier
for a nonability is +0.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills:</span> This line
gives the creature&rsquo;s skills, along with each skill&rsquo;s
modifier (including adjustments for ability scores, armor check
penalties, and any bonuses from feats or racial traits). All listed
skills are class skills, unless the creature has a character class
(noted in the entry). A creature&rsquo;s type and Intelligence score
determine the number of skill points it has.</p>
      <p>The Skills section of the creature&rsquo;s description recaps
racial bonuses and other adjustments to skill modifiers for the sake of
clarity; these bonuses should not be added to the listed skill
modifiers.</p>
      <p>An asterisk (*) beside the relevant score and in the Skills
section of the descriptive text indicates a conditional adjustment, one
that applies only in certain situations.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Natural Tendencies:</span>
Some creatures simply aren&rsquo;t made for certain types of physical
activity. If it seems clear that a particular creature simply is not
made for a particular physical activity, that creature takes a &ndash;8
penalty on skill checks that defy its natural tendencies.</p>
      <p>In extreme circumstances the creature fails the check automatically.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats:</span> The line gives
the creature&rsquo;s feats. A monster gains feats just as a character
does. Sometimes a creature has one or more bonus feats, marked with a
superscript B (B). Creatures often do not have the prerequisites for a
bonus feat. If this is so, the creature can still use the feat. If you
wish to customize the creature with new feats, you can reassign its
other feats, but not its bonus feats. A creature cannot have a feat
that is not a bonus feat unless it has the feat&rsquo;s prerequisites.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Environment:</span> This line
gives a type of climate and terrain where the creature is typically
found. This describes a tendency, but is not exclusionary.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Organization:</span> This
line describes the kinds of groups the creature might form. A range of
numbers in parentheses indicates how many combat-ready adults are in
each type of group. Many groups also have a number of noncombatants,
expressed as a percentage of the fighting population. Noncombatants can
include young, the infirm, slaves, or other individuals who are not
inclined to fight. If the organization line contains the term
&ldquo;domesticated,&rdquo; the creature is generally found only in the
company of other creatures, whom it serves in some capacity.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span> This shows the average level of a party of adventurers for which one creature would make an encounter of moderate difficulty.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Treasure:</span> This line
reflects how much wealth the creature owns. In most cases, a creature
keeps valuables in its home or lair and has no treasure with it when it
travels. Intelligent creatures that own useful, portable treasure (such
as magic items) tend to carry and use these, leaving bulky items at
home.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alignment:</span> This line
gives the alignment that the creature is most likely to have. Every
entry includes a qualifier that indicates how broadly that alignment
applies to the species as a whole.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Advancement:</span> The
monster entry usually describes only the most commonly encountered
version of a creature. The advancement line shows how tough a creature
can get, in terms of extra Hit Dice. (This is not an absolute limit,
but exceptions are extremely rare.) Often, intelligent creatures
advance by gaining a level in a character class instead of just gaining
a new Hit Die.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Level Adjustment:</span> This
line is included in the entries of creatures suitable for use as player
characters or as cohorts (usually creatures with Intelligence scores of
at least 3 and possessing opposable thumbs). Add this number to the
creature&rsquo;s total Hit Dice, including class levels, to get the
creature&rsquo;s effective character level (ECL). A character&rsquo;s
ECL affects the experience the character earns, the amount of
experience the character must have before gaining a new level, and the
character&rsquo;s starting equipment.<br>
