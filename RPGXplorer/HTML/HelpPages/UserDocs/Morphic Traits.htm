      <p>This trait measures how easily the basic nature of a plane can
be changed. Some planes are responsive to sentient thought, while
others can be manipulated only by extremely powerful creatures. And
some planes respond to physical or magical efforts.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Alterable Morphic:</span> On
a plane with this trait, objects remain where they are (and what they
are) unless affected by physical force or magic. You can change the
immediate environment as a result of tangible effort.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Highly Morphic:</span> On a
plane with this trait, features of the plane change so frequently that
it&rsquo;s difficult to keep a particular area stable. Such planes may
react dramatically to specific spells, sentient thought, or the force
of will. Others change for no reason.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Magically Morphic:</span> Specific spells can alter the basic material of a plane with this trait.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Divinely Morphic:</span>
Specific unique beings (deities or similar great powers) have the
ability to alter objects, creatures, and the landscape on planes with
this trait. Ordinary characters find these planes similar to alterable
planes in that they may be affected by spells and physical effort. But
the deities may cause these areas to change instantly and dramatically,
creating great kingdoms for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Static:</span> These planes
are unchanging. Visitors cannot affect living residents of the plane,
nor objects that the denizens possess. Any spells that would affect
those on the plane have no effect unless the plane&rsquo;s static trait
is somehow removed or suppressed. Spells cast before entering a plane
with the static trait remain in effect, however.</p>
      <p>Even moving an unattended object within a static plane
requires a DC 16 Strength check. Particularly heavy objects may be
impossible to move.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Sentient:</span> These
planes are ones that respond to a single thought- that of the plane
itself. Travelers would find the plane&rsquo;s landscape changing as a
result of what the plane thought of the travelers, either becoming more
or less hospitable depending on its reaction.
