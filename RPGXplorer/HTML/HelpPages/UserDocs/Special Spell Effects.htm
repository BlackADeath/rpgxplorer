      <p>Many special spell effects are handled according to the school
of the spells in question Certain other special spell features are
found across spell schools.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacks:</span> Some spell
descriptions refer to attacking. All offensive combat actions, even
those that don&rsquo;t damage opponents are considered attacks.
Attempts to turn or rebuke undead count as attacks. All spells that
opponents resist with saving throws, that deal damage, or that
otherwise harm or hamper subjects are attacks. Spells that summon
monsters or other allies are not attacks because the spells themselves
don&rsquo;t harm anyone.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bonus Types:</span> Usually,
a bonus has a type that indicates how the spell grants the bonus. The
important aspect of bonus types is that two bonuses of the same type
don&rsquo;t generally stack. With the exception of dodge bonuses, most
circumstance bonuses, and racial bonuses, only the better bonus works
(see Combining Magical Effects, below). The same principle applies to
penalties - a character taking two or more penalties of the same type
applies only the worst one.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bringing Back the Dead: </span>Several spells have the power to restore slain characters to life.</p>
      <p>When a living creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves
the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide
on the plane where the creature&rsquo;s deity resides. If the creature
did not worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to
its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving his
or her soul and returning it to his or her body.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Level Loss:</span> Any
creature brought back to life usually loses one level of experience.
The character&rsquo;s new XP total is midway between the minimum needed
for his or her new (reduced) level and the minimum needed for the next
one. If the character was 1st level at the time of death, he or she
loses 2 points of Constitution instead of losing a level.</p>
      <p>This level loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any mortal means, even<span style="font-style: italic;"> wish</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">miracle.</span>
A revived character can regain a lost level by earning XP through
further adventuring. A revived character who was 1st level at the time
of death can regain lost points of Constitution by improving his or her
Constitution score when he or she attains a level that allows an
ability score increase.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Preventing Revivification: </span>Enemies
can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned
from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using<span style="font-style: italic;"> raise dead </span>or <span style="font-style: italic;">resurrection</span> to restore the slain character to life. Casting <span style="font-style: italic;">trap the soul</span> prevents any sort of revivification unless the soul is first released.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Revivification against One&rsquo;s Will:</span>
A soul cannot be returned to life if it does not wish to be. A soul
knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character
attempting to revive it and may refuse to return on that basis.
