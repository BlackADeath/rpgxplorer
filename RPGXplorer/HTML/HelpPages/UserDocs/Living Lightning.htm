      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 300 ft. or 150 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> A bolt 5 ft. wide by 300 ft. long, or 10 ft. wide by 150 ft. long<br>

      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To Develop:</span> 1,260,000 gp; 26 days; 50,400 XP. Seeds: <span style="font-style: italic;">life</span> (DC 27), <span style="font-style: italic;">energy</span>
(DC 19). Factors: 1-action casting time (+20 DC), no verbal or somatic
components (+4 DC), giving life to a spell (ad hoc x2 DC). </p>

      
      <p>The character develops a spell that he or she can cast;
thereafter, the spell can effectively &ldquo;cast itself.&rdquo; When
the character casts the spell, a stroke of energy deals 10d6 points of
electricity damage to each creature within the spell&rsquo;s area.
Living lightning follows all the standard rules for epic spell casting
when the character casts it. Living lightning is sentient and generally
friendly toward the character. It has the character&rsquo;s mental
ability scores, but it has no physical ability scores. It senses the
world through the character&rsquo;s senses and communicates with him or
her by thought. As a self-triggering spell, it isn&rsquo;t truly alive
but is a fragment of the character&rsquo;s personality. It cares little
for the world around it, but at the character&rsquo;s urging (and
sometimes at its own discretion) it casts itself at his or her foes.
Casters who prepare spells before casting must prepare living lightning
normally in order for it to cast itself. When the spell casts itself,
it acts on the character&rsquo;s initiative but does not count against
his or her own actions in the round. The character cannot
simultaneously cast living lightning while it is casting its own
effect, even if it has been prepared more than once. Living lightning
uses up one of the character&rsquo;s epic spell slots for the day
whenever it casts itself. When the character has used up all his or her
epic spell slots for the day (or has cast all his or her prepared
living lightning spells, if a caster who must prepare spells), living
lightning becomes quiescent. It remains so until the character has
rested to regain his or her epic spell slots for the next day. </p>
