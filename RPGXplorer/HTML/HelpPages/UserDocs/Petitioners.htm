      <p>Some spirits demonstrate their devotion to their deity by
traveling to the deity&rsquo;s home plane. Those that survive the
journey across the planes become servants of their deity. While a few
may remain disembodied spirits, most become petitioners through the
divine will of their patron deity.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In general, petitioners appear in the form that they had when
they died, though they may be remade by deities to fit the nature of
their particular afterlife. In general, petitioners who become divine
servants are creatures that originally had at least 1 Intelligence and
1 Wisdom.</p>
      <p>The following creature types may become petitioners depending
on the deity: aberrations, animals, dragons, fey, giants, humanoids,
magical beasts, monstrous humanoids, and plants, oozes, and vermin with
sufficient ability scores. Constructs and undead are not usually made
into petitioners, though the spirits of their original forms may be.
Elementals and outsiders tend to meld with their native planes, and as
such do not become petitioners. Their spirits may still be called back
from the dead, however.</p>
      <p>The template presented below is for NPCs, not player
characters. If dead characters who are petitioners are later restored
to life (once again becoming player characters), they forget any of
their experiences as petitioners.&nbsp;</p>
