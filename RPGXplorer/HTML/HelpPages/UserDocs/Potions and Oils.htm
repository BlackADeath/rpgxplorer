      <p>A potion is a magic liquid that produces its effect when
imbibed. Magic oils are similar to potions, except that oils are
applied externally rather than imbibed. A potion or oil can be used
only once. It can duplicate the effect of a spell of up to 3rd level
that has a casting time of less than 1 minute.</p>
      <p>Potions are like spells cast upon the imbiber. The character
taking the potion doesn&rsquo;t get to make any decisions about the
effect - the caster who brewed the potion has already done so. The
drinker of a potion is both the effective target and the caster of the
effect (though the potion indicates the caster level, the drinker still
controls the effect).</p>
      <p>The person applying an oil is the effective caster, but the object is the target.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description:</span>
A typical potion or oil consists of 1 ounce of liquid held in a ceramic
or glass vial fitted with a tight stopper. The stoppered container is
usually no more than 1 inch wide and 2 inches high. The vial has AC 13,
1 hit point, hardness 1, and a break DC of 12. Vials hold 1 ounce of
liquid.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Identifying Potions:</span>
In addition to the standard methods of identification, PCs can sample
from each container they find to attempt to determine the nature of the
liquid inside. An experienced character learns to identify potions by
memory - for example, the last time she tasted a liquid that reminded
her of almonds, it turned out to be a potion of cure moderate
wounds.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation: </span>Drinking a
potion or applying an oil requires no special skill. The user merely
removes the stopper and swallows the potion or smears on the oil. The
following rules govern potion and oil use.</p>
      <p>Drinking a potion or using an oil on an item of gear is a
standard action. The potion or oil takes effect immediately. Using a
potion or oil provokes attacks of opportunity. A successful attack
(including grappling attacks) against the character forces a
Concentration check (as for casting a spell). If the character fails
this check, she cannot drink the potion. An enemy may direct an attack
of opportunity against the potion or oil container rather than against
the character. A successful attack of this sort can destroy the
container.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A creature must be able to swallow a potion or smear on an
oil. Because of this, incorporeal creatures cannot use potions or
oils.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Any corporeal creature can imbibe a potion. The potion must be swallowed. Any corporeal creature can use an oil.</p>
      <p>A character can carefully administer a potion to an
unconscious creature as a full-round action, trickling the liquid down
the creature&rsquo;s throat. Likewise, it takes a full-round action to
apply an oil to an unconscious creature.</p>
