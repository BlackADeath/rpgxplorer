      <p>The combination of high peaks and heavy snowfalls means that
avalanches are a deadly peril in many mountainous areas. While
avalanches of snow and ice are common, it&rsquo;s also possible to have
an avalanche of rock and soil.</p>
      <p>An avalanche can be spotted from as far away as 1d10&times;500
feet downslope by a character who makes a DC 20 Spot check, treating
the avalanche as a Colossal creature. If all characters fail their Spot
checks to determine the encounter distance, the avalanche moves closer
to them, and they automatically become aware of it when it closes to
half the original distance. It&rsquo;s possible to hear an avalanche
coming even if you can&rsquo;t see it. Under optimum conditions (no
other loud noises occurring), a character who makes a DC 15 Listen
check can hear the avalanche or landslide when it is 1d6&times;500 feet
away. This check might have a DC of 20, 25, or higher in conditions
where hearing is difficult (such as in the middle of a
thunderstorm).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A landslide or avalanche consists of two distinct areas: the
bury zone (in the direct path of the falling debris) and the slide zone
(the area the debris spreads out to encompass). Characters in the bury
zone always take damage from the avalanche; characters in the slide
zone may be able to get out of the way. Characters in the bury zone
take 8d6 points of damage, or half that amount if they make a DC 15
Reflex save. They are subsequently buried (see below). Characters in
the slide zone take 3d6 points of damage, or no damage if they make a
DC 15 Reflex save. Those who fail their saves are buried.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Buried characters take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per
minute. If a buried character falls unconscious, he or she must make a
DC 15 Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each
minute thereafter until freed or dead.</p>
      <p>The typical avalanche has a width of 1d6&times;100 feet, from
one edge of the slide zone to the opposite edge. The bury zone in the
center of the avalanche is half as wide as the avalanche&rsquo;s full
width.</p>
      <p>To determine the precise location of characters in the path of
an avalanche, roll 1d6&times;20; the result is the number of feet from
the center of the path taken by the bury zone to the center of the
party&rsquo;s location. Avalanches of snow and ice advance at a speed
of 500 feet per round, and rock avalanches travel at a speed of 250
feet per round.
