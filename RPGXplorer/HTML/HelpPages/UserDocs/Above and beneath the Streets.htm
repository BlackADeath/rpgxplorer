      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Rooftops:</span> Getting to a
roof usually requires climbing a wall (see the Walls section), unless
the character can reach a roof by jumping down from a higher window,
balcony, or bridge. Flat roofs, common only in warm climates
(accumulated snow can cause a flat roof to collapse), are easy to run
across. Moving along the peak of a roof requires a DC 20 Balance check.
Moving on an angled roof surface without changing altitude (moving
parallel to the peak, in other words) requires a DC 15 Balance check.
Moving up and down across the peak of a roof requires a DC 10 Balance
check.</p>
      <p>Eventually a character runs out of roof, requiring a long jump
across to the next roof or down to the ground. The distance to the next
closest roof is usually 1d3&times;5 feet horizontally, but the roof
across the gap is equally likely to be 5 feet higher, 5 feet lower, or
the same height. Use the guidelines in the Jump skill (a horizontal
jump&rsquo;s peak height is one-fourth of the horizontal distance) to
determine whether a character can make a jump.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sewers:</span> To get into
the sewers, most characters open a grate (a full-round action) and jump
down 10 feet. Sewers are built exactly like dungeons, except that
they&rsquo;re much more likely to have floors that are slippery or
covered with water. Sewers are also similar to dungeons in terms of
creatures liable to be encountered therein. Some cities were built atop
the ruins of older civilizations, so their sewers sometimes lead to
treasures and dangers from a bygone age.
