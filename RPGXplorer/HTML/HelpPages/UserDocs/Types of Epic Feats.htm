      <p>Most epic feats are general, meaning that no special rules
govern them as a group. Others may be item creation feats or metamagic
feats, which follow all the normal rules for such feats, except as
specified in the feat&rsquo;s description. In addition, some feats are
defined as divine feats or as wild feats. Such feats are described
below. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Divine Feats:</span> The
feats in this category share a few characteristics. First, they all
have as a prerequisite the ability to turn (or, in most cases, rebuke)
undead. Thus, they are open to clerics, paladins of 4th level or
higher, and any prestige class that has that ability. (An ability to
turn other creatures does not qualify a character to select one of
these feats.) Second, the force that powers a divine feat is the
ability to channel positive or negative energy to turn or rebuke
undead. Each use of a divine feat costs the character one turn/rebuke
attempt from his or her number of attempts each day. If a character
doesn&rsquo;t have any turn/rebuke attempts left, he or she can&rsquo;t
use the feat. Since turning or rebuking is a standard action,
activating any of these feats is also a standard action. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wild Feats:</span> The feats
in this category share the characteristic of relating to the ability to
use wild shape as a druid. These feats require the character to have
the ability to use wild shape before acquiring the feat. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Epic Psionic Feats:</span>
Psionic characters can acquire epic &ldquo;psionically flavored&rdquo;
feats.&nbsp; Some feats require so much translation that converted
feats are provided. Whenever a feat concerns conferring or altering a
spell in some fashion, some translation must be done to use it with
psionics. Sometimes this translation is as straightforward as changing
a few names. Translating epic metamagic feats to epic metapsionic feats
requires that Spellcraft prerequisites be replaced with Psicraft. It
also requires a little math - instead of casting a spell at a higher
level, a psionic character pays more power points. For every spell slot
one level higher than the spell&rsquo;s actual level the metamagic feat
requires, the metapsionic feat requires a character to pay a power
point cost equal to its standard cost +2. Likewise, when a feat allows
a spellcaster to &ldquo;pay&rdquo; one less level to use a metamagic
feat, the psionic version allows a character to pay 2 power points less
for a given metapsionic feat. </p>
