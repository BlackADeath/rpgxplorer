      <p>This seed can grant a creature protection from damage of a
specified type. The caster can protect a creature from standard damage
or from energy damage. The caster can protect a creature or area from
magic. Alternatively, he or she can hedge out a type of creature from a
specified area. A ward against standard damage protects a creature from
whichever two the caster selects of the three damage types:
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For a ward against all three
types, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. Each round, the spell created
with the ward seed absorbs the first 5 points of damage the creature
would otherwise take, regardless of whether the source of the damage is
natural or magical. For each additional point of protection, increase
the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p>

      
      <p>A ward against energy grants a creature protection from
whichever one the caster selects of the five energy types: acid, cold,
electricity, fire, or sonic. Each round, the spell absorbs the first 5
points of damage the creature would otherwise take from the specified
energy type, regardless of whether the source of damage is natural or
magical. The spell protects the recipient&rsquo;s equipment as well.
For each additional point of protection, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+1. </p>

      
      <p>A ward against a specific type of creature prevents bodily
contact from whichever one of several monster types the caster selects.
This causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and
the creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded
creature. The protection ends if the warded creature makes an attack
against or intentionally moves within 5 feet of the blocked creature.
Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome this protection and
touch the warded creature. </p>

      
      <p>A ward against magic creates an immobile, faintly shimmering
magical sphere (with radius 10 feet) that surrounds the caster and
excludes all spell effects of up to 1st level. Alternatively, the
caster can ward just the target and not create the radius effect. For
each additional level of spells to be excluded, increase the Spellcraft
DC by +20 (but see below). The area or effect of any such spells does
not include the area of the ward, and such spells fail to affect any
target within the ward. This includes spell-like abilities and spells
or spell-like effects from magic items. However, any type of spell can
be cast through or out of the ward. The caster can leave and return to
the protected area without penalty (unless the spell specifically
targets a creature and does not provide a radius effect). The ward
could be brought down by a targeted dispel magic spell. Epic spells
using the dispel seed may bring down a ward if the enemy spellcaster
succeeds at a caster level check. The ward may also be brought down
with a targeted epic spell using the destroy seed if the enemy
spellcaster succeeds at a caster level check. </p>

      
      <p>Instead of creating an epic spell that uses the ward seed to
nullify all spells of a given level and lower, the caster can create a
ward that nullifies a specific spell (or specific set of spells). For
each specific spell so nullified, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2 per
spell level above 1st. </p>
