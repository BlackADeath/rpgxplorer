      <p>Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland
movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per
day. A day represents 8 hours of actual travel time. For rowed
watercraft, a day represents 10 hours of rowing. For a sailing ship, it
represents 24 hours.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Walk:</span> A character can
walk 8 hours in a day of travel without a problem. Walking for longer
than that can wear him or her out (see Forced March, below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hustle: </span>A character
can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in
between sleep cycles deals 1 point of nonlethal damage, and each
additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour
of hustling. A character who takes any nonlethal damage from hustling
becomes fatigued.</p>
      <p>A fatigued character can&rsquo;t run or charge and takes a
penalty of -2 to Strength and Dexterity. Eliminating the nonlethal
damage also eliminates the fatigue.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run:</span> A character can&rsquo;t run for an extended period of time.</p>
      <p>Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Terrain:</span> The terrain
through which a character travels affects how much distance he or she
can cover in an hour or a day (see Table: Terrain and Overland
Movement). A highway is a straight, major, paved road. A road is
typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows
only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with
vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Forced March: </span>In a day
of normal walking, a character walks for 8 hours. The rest of the
daylight time is spent making and breaking camp, resting, and eating.<br>
A character can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced
march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, a Constitution check
(DC 10, +2 per extra hour) is required. If the check fails, the
character takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who takes
any nonlethal damage from a forced march becomes fatigued. Eliminating
the nonlethal damage also eliminates the fatigue. It&rsquo;s possible
for a character to march into unconsciousness by pushing himself too
hard.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mounted Movement:</span> A
mount bearing a rider can move at a hustle. The damage it takes when
doing so, however, is lethal damage, not nonlethal damage. The creature
can also be ridden in a forced march, but its Constitution checks
automatically fail, and, again, the damage it takes is lethal damage.
Mounts also become fatigued when they take any damage from hustling or
forced marches.</p>
      <p>See Table: Mounts and Vehicles for mounted speeds and speeds for vehicles pulled by draft animals.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Waterborne Movement:</span> See Table: Mounts and Vehicles for speeds for water vehicles.
