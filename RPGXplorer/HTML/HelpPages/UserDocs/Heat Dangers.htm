      <p>Heat deals nonlethal damage that cannot be recovered until the
character gets cooled off (reaches shade, survives until nightfall,
gets doused in water, is targeted by endure elements, and so forth).
Once rendered unconscious through the accumulation of nonlethal damage,
the character begins to take lethal damage at the same rate.</p>
      <p>A character in very hot conditions (above 90&deg; F) must make
a Fortitude saving throw each hour (DC 15, +1 for each previous check)
or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy
clothing or armor of any sort take a -4 penalty on their saves. A
character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving
throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well
(see the skill description). Characters reduced to unconsciousness
begin taking lethal damage (1d4 points per hour).</p>
      <p>In severe heat (above 110&deg; F), a character must make a
Fortitude save once every 10 minutes (DC 15, +1 for each previous
check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Characters wearing heavy
clothing or armor of any sort take a -4 penalty on their saves. A
character with the Survival skill may receive a bonus on this saving
throw and may be able to apply this bonus to other characters as well.
Characters reduced to unconsciousness begin taking lethal damage (1d4
points per each 10-minute period).</p>
      <p>A character who takes any nonlethal damage from heat exposure now suffers from heatstroke and is fatigued.</p>
      <p>These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage she took from the heat.</p>
      <p>Extreme heat (air temperature over 140&deg; F, fire, boiling
water, lava) deals lethal damage. Breathing air in these temperatures
deals 1d6 points of damage per minute (no save). In addition, a
character must make a Fortitude save every 5 minutes (DC 15, +1 per
previous check) or take 1d4 points of nonlethal damage. Those wearing
heavy clothing or any sort of armor take a -4 penalty on their saves.
In addition, those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with very
hot metal are affected as if by a heat metal spell.<br>
Boiling water deals 1d6 points of scalding damage, unless the character
is fully immersed, in which case it deals 10d6 points of damage per
round of exposure.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Catching on Fire</p>
      <p>Characters exposed to burning oil, bonfires, and
noninstantaneous magic fires might find their clothes, hair, or
equipment on fire. Spells with an instantaneous duration don&rsquo;t
normally set a character on fire, since the heat and flame from these
come and go in a flash.</p>
      <p>Characters at risk of catching fire are allowed a DC 15 Reflex
save to avoid this fate. If a character&rsquo;s clothes or hair catch
fire, he takes 1d6 points of damage immediately. In each subsequent
round, the burning character must make another Reflex saving throw.
Failure means he takes another 1d6 points of damage that round. Success
means that the fire has gone out. (That is, once he succeeds on his
saving throw, he&rsquo;s no longer on fire.)</p>
      <p>A character on fire may automatically extinguish the flames by
jumping into enough water to douse himself. If no body of water is at
hand, rolling on the ground or smothering the fire with cloaks or the
like permits the character another save with a +4 bonus.</p>
      <p>Those unlucky enough to have their clothes or equipment catch
fire must make DC 15 Reflex saves for each item. Flammable items that
fail take the same amount of damage as the character.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Lava Effects</p>
      <p>Lava or magma deals 2d6 points of damage per round of
exposure, except in the case of total immersion (such as when a
character falls into the crater of an active volcano), which deals 20d6
points of damage per round.</p>
      <p>Damage from magma continues for 1d3 rounds after exposure
ceases, but this additional damage is only half of that dealt during
actual contact (that is, 1d6 or 10d6 points per round).</p>
      <p>An immunity or resistance to fire serves as an immunity to
lava or magma. However, a creature immune to fire might still drown if
completely immersed in lava (see Drowning, below).
