      <p>The caster of this seed can see some distant location or hear
the sounds at some distant location almost as if he or she was there.
To both hear and see, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. Distance is not
a factor, but the locale must be known - a place familiar to the caster
or an obvious one. The spell creates an invisible sensor that can be
dispelled. Lead sheeting or magical protection blocks the spell, and
the caster senses that the spell is so blocked. If the caster prefers
to create a mobile sensor (speed 30 feet) that he or she controls,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. To use the reveal seed to reach one
specific different plane of existence, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+8. To allow magically enhanced senses to work through a spell built
with the reveal seed, increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. To cast any
spell from the sensor whose range is touch or greater, increase the
Spellcraft DC by +6; however, the caster must maintain line of effect
to the sensor at all times. If the line of effect is obstructed, the
spell ends. To free the caster of the line of effect restriction for
casting spells through the sensor, multiply the Spellcraft DC by x10. </p>

      
      <p>The reveal seed has a base Spellcraft DC of 25 if used to
pierce illusions and see things as they really are. The caster can see
through normal and magical darkness, notice secret doors hidden by
magic, see the exact locations of creatures or objects under blur or
displacement effects, see invisible creatures or objects normally, see
through illusions, see onto the Ethereal Plane (but not into
extradimensional spaces), and see the true form of polymorphed,
changed, or transmuted things. The range of such sight is 120 feet. </p>

      
      <p>The reveal seed can also be used to develop spells that will
do any one of the following: duplicate the read magic spell, comprehend
the written and verbal language of another, or speak in the written or
verbal language of another. To both comprehend and speak a language,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +4. </p>
