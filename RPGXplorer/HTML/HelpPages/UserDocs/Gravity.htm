      <p>The direction of gravity&rsquo;s pull may be unusual, and it might even change directions within the plane itself.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Normal Gravity:</span> Most
planes have gravity similar to that of the Material Plane. The usual
rules for ability scores, carrying capacity, and encumbrance apply.
Unless otherwise noted in a description, it is assumed every plane has
the normal gravity trait.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Heavy Gravity:</span> The
gravity on a plane with this trait is much more intense than on the
Material Plane. As a result, Balance, Climb, Jump, Ride, Swim, and
Tumble checks incur a -2 circumstance penalty, as do all attack rolls.
All item weights are effectively doubled, which might affect a
character&rsquo;s speed. Weapon ranges are halved. A character&rsquo;s
Strength and Dexterity scores are not affected. Characters who fall on
a heavy gravity plane take 1d10 points of damage for each 10 feet
fallen, to a maximum of 20d10 points of damage.<br>
      </p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Light Gravity: </span>The
gravity on a plane with this trait is less intense than on the Material
Plane. As a result, creatures find that they can lift more, but their
movements tend to be ungainly. Characters on a plane with the light
gravity trait take a -2 circumstance penalty on attack rolls and
Balance, Ride, Swim, and Tumble checks. All items weigh half as much.
Weapon ranges double, and characters gain a +2 circumstance bonus on
Climb and Jump checks.</p>
      <p>Strength and Dexterity don&rsquo;t change as a result of light
gravity, but what you can do with such scores does change. These
advantages apply to travelers from other planes as well as natives.</p>
      <p>Falling characters on a light gravity plane take 1d4 points of damage for each 10 feet of the fall (maximum 20d4).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">No Gravity:</span>
Individuals on a plane with this trait merely float in space, unless
other resources are available to provide a direction for
gravity&rsquo;s pull.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Objective Directional Gravity:</span>
The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on
the Material Plane, but the direction is not the traditional
&ldquo;down&rdquo; toward the ground. It may be down toward any solid
object, at an angle to the surface of the plane itself, or even upward.</p>
      <p>In addition, objective directional gravity may change from place to place. The direction of &ldquo;down&rdquo; may vary.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Subjective Directional Gravity:</span>
The strength of gravity on a plane with this trait is the same as on
the Material Plane, but each individual chooses the direction of
gravity&rsquo;s pull. Such a plane has no gravity for unattended
objects and nonsentient creatures. This sort of environment can be very
disorienting to the newcomer, but is common on &ldquo;weightless&rdquo;
planes.</p>
      <p>Characters on a plane with subjective directional gravity can
move normally along a solid surface by imagining &ldquo;down&rdquo;
near their feet. If suspended in midair, a character
&ldquo;flies&rdquo; by merely choosing a &ldquo;down&rdquo; direction
and &ldquo;falling&rdquo; that way. Under such a procedure, an
individual &ldquo;falls&rdquo; 150 feet in the first round and 300 feet
in each succeeding round. Movement is straight-line only. In order to
stop, one has to slow one&rsquo;s movement by changing the designated
&ldquo;down&rdquo; direction (again, moving 150 feet in the new
direction in the first round and 300 feet per round thereafter).</p>
      <p>It takes a DC 16 Wisdom check to set a new direction of
gravity as a free action; this check can be made once per round. Any
character who fails this Wisdom check in successive rounds receives a
+6 bonus on subsequent checks until he or she succeeds.
