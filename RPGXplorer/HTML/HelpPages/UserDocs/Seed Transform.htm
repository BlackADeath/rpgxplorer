      <p>Transmutation<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spellcraft DC:</span> 21<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Components:</span> V, S<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time:</span> 1 minute<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 300 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target:</span> One creature or inanimate, nonmagical object<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> Permanent<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Resistance:</span> Yes </p>

      
      <p>Spells using the transform seed change the subject into
another form of creature or object. The new form can range in size from
Diminutive to one size larger than the subject&rsquo;s normal form. For
each additional increment of size change, increase the Spellcraft DC by
+6. If the caster wants to transform a nonmagical, inanimate object
into a creature of his or her type or transform a creature into a
nonmagical, inanimate object, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. To
change a creature of one type into another type increase the Spellcraft
DC by +5. </p>

      
      <p>Transformations involving nonmagical, inanimate substances
with hardness are more difficult; for each 2 points of hardness,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +1. </p>

      
      <p>To transform a creature into an incorporeal or gaseous form,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. Conversely, to overcome the natural
immunity of a gaseous or incorporeal creature to transformation,
increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. </p>

      
      <p>The transform seed can also change its target into someone
specific. To transform an object or creature into the specific likeness
of another individual (including memories and mental abilities),
increase the Spellcraft DC by +25. If the transformed creature
doesn&rsquo;t have the level or Hit Dice of its new likeness, it can
only use the abilities of the creature at its own level or Hit Dice. If
slain or destroyed, the transformed creature or object reverts to its
original form. The subject&rsquo;s equipment, if any, remains
untransformed or melds into the new form&rsquo;s body, at the
caster&rsquo;s option. The transformed creature or object acquires the
physical and natural abilities of the creature or object it has been
changed into while retaining its own memories and mental ability
scores. Mental abilities include personality, Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores, level and class, hit points (despite any change in its
Constitution score), alignment, base attack bonus, base saves,
extraordinary abilities, spells, and spell-like abilities, but not its
supernatural abilities. Physical abilities include natural size and
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. Natural abilities include
armor, natural weapons, and similar gross physical qualities (presence
or absence of wings, number of extremities, and so forth), and possibly
hardness. Creatures transformed into inanimate objects do not gain the
benefit of their untransformed physical abilities, and may well be
blind, deaf, dumb, and unfeeling. Objects transformed into creatures
gain that creature&rsquo;s average physical ability scores, but are
considered to have mental ability scores of 0 (the fortify seed can add
points to each mental ability, if desired). For each normal
extraordinary ability or supernatural ability granted to the
transformed creature, increase the Spellcraft DC by +10. The
transformed subject can have no more Hit Dice than the caster has or
than the subject has (whichever is greater). In any case, for each Hit
Die the assumed form has above 15, increase the Spellcraft DC by +2. </p>
