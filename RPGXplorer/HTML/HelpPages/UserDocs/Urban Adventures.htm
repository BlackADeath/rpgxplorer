      <p>At first glance, a city is much like a dungeon, made up of
walls, doors, rooms, and corridors. Adventures that take place in
cities have two salient differences from their dungeon counterparts,
however. Characters have greater access to resources, and they must
contend with law enforcement.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Access to Resources:</span>
Unlike in dungeons and the wilderness, characters can buy and sell gear
quickly in a city. A large city or metropolis probably has high-level
NPCs and experts in obscure fields of knowledge who can provide
assistance and decipher clues. And when the PCs are battered and
bruised, they can retreat to the comfort of a room at the inn.</p>

      
      <p>The freedom to retreat and ready access to the marketplace
means that the players have a greater degree of control over the pacing
of an urban adventure.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Law Enforcement:</span> The
other key distinctions between adventuring in a city and delving into a
dungeon is that a dungeon is, almost by definition, a lawless place
where the only law is that of the jungle: Kill or be killed. A city, on
the other hand, is held together by a code of laws, many of which are
explicitly designed to prevent the sort of behavior that adventurers
engage in all the time: killing and looting. Even so, most
cities&rsquo; laws recognize monsters as a threat to the stability the
city relies on, and prohibitions about murder rarely apply to monsters
such as aberrations or evil outsiders. Most evil humanoids, however,
are typically protected by the same laws that protect all the citizens
of the city. Having an evil alignment is not a crime (except in some
severely theocratic cities, perhaps, with the magical power to back up
the law); only evil deeds are against the law. Even when adventurers
encounter an evildoer in the act of perpetrating some heinous evil upon
the populace of the city, the law tends to frown on the sort of
vigilante justice that leaves the evildoer dead or otherwise unable to
testify at a trial.</p>

      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapon And Spell Restrictions: </span>Different cities have different laws about such issues as carrying weapons in public and restricting spellcasters.</p>

      
      <p>The city&rsquo;s laws may not affect all characters equally. A
monk isn&rsquo;t hampered at all by a law about peace-bonding weapons,
but a cleric is reduced to a fraction of his power if all holy symbols
are confiscated at the city&rsquo;s gates.</p>

      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Urban Features: </span>Walls, doors, poor lighting, and uneven footing: In many ways
a city is much like a dungeon. Some new considerations for an urban
setting are covered below.
