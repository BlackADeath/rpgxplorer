      <p>When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged
touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart
and the goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough
and resilient upon exposure to air. An entangled creature takes a
&ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls and a &ndash;4 penalty to Dexterity
and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued to the floor, unable to
move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge
or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying
creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex
save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall
to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>
      <p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can
break free by making a DC 17 Strength check or by dealing 15 points of
damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape
goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an
attack roll; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature
that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped
off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed.
A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by the goo must make a
DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo becomes brittle and
fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness.
An application of universal solvent to a stuck creature dissolves the
alchemical goo immediately.&nbsp;
