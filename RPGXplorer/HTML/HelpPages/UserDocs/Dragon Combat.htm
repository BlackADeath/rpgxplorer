      <p>A dragon
attacks with its powerful claws and bite, and can also use a breath
weapon and special physical attacks, depending on its size. It prefers
to fight on the wing, staying out of reach until it has worn down the
enemy with ranged attacks. Older, more intelligent dragons are adept at
sizing up the opposition and eliminating the most dangerous foes first
(or avoiding them while picking off weaker enemies).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bite:</span> Bite attacks
deal the indicated damage plus the dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus. A
dragon also can use its bite to snatch opponents if it has the Snatch
feat.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Claw:</span> Claw attacks
deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus
(round down). The dragon also can use its claws to snatch opponents if
it has the Snatch feat. Claw attacks are secondary attacks, requiring a
&ndash;5 penalty on the attack roll. (Many dragons choose the
Multiattack feat to lessen this penalty to &ndash;2).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wing:</span> The dragon can
slam opponents with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks deal the
indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus (round
down) and are treated as secondary attacks.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tail Slap:</span> The dragon
can slap one opponent each round with its tail. A tail slap deals the
indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus
(round down) and is treated as a secondary attack.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Crush (Ex):</span> This
special attack allows a flying or jumping dragon of at least Huge size
to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to
crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or
more size categories smaller than the dragon (though it can attempt
normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the
dragon&rsquo;s body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a
Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon) or
be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next
round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to
maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents
take damage from the crush each round if they don&rsquo;t escape.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus (round down).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tail Sweep (Ex):</span> This
special attack allows a dragon of at least Gargantuan size to sweep
with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle
with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending
from an intersection on the edge of the dragon&rsquo;s space in any
direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are
four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep
automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the
dragon&rsquo;s Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can
attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the
dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon).</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Grappling:</span> Dragons do
not favor grapple attacks, though their crush attack (and Snatch feat,
if they know it) use normal grapple rules. A dragon can always use its
breath weapon while grappling, as well as its spells and spell-like or
supernatural abilities, provided it succeeds on Concentration checks.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Breath Weapon (Su):</span>
Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it
can&rsquo;t breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. If a dragon has more
than one type of breath weapon, it still can breathe only once every
1d4 rounds. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any
intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the
dragon&rsquo;s choice, with an area as noted on the table below. If the
breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt
Reflex saves to take half damage; the DC depends on the dragon&rsquo;s
age and variety, and is given in each individual entry. Saves against
nondamaging breath weapons use the same DC; the kind of saving throw is
noted in the variety descriptions. The save DC against a breath weapon
is 10 + 1/2 dragon&rsquo;s HD + dragon&rsquo;s Con modifier.</p>





      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Breath weapons come in two basic shapes, line and cone, whose areas vary with the dragon&rsquo;s size.</p>

      <p>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">Frightful Presence (Ex):</span>
A young adult or older dragon can unsettle foes with its mere presence.
The ability takes effect automatically whenever the dragon attacks,
charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 30 feet x the
dragon&rsquo;s age category are subject to the effect if they have
fewer HD than the dragon. A potentially affected creature that succeeds
on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 dragon&rsquo;s HD + dragon&rsquo;s Cha
modifier) remains immune to that dragon&rsquo;s frightful presence for
24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for
4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds.
Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spells:</span> A dragon knows
and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its
variety description, gaining bonus spells for a high Charisma score.
Some dragons can also cast spells from the cleric list or cleric domain
lists as arcane spells.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell-Like Abilities:</span>
A dragon&rsquo;s spell-like abilities depend on its age and variety. It
gains the abilities indicated for its age plus all previous ones. Its
age category or its sorcerer caster level, whichever is higher, is the
caster level for these abilities. The save DC is 10 + dragon&rsquo;s
Cha modifier + spell level. All spell-like abilities are usable once
per day unless otherwise noted.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage Reduction: </span>Young
adult and older dragons have damage reduction. Their natural weapons
are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage
reduction.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Immunities (Ex): </span>All
dragons have immunity to sleep and paralysis effects. Each variety of
dragon has immunity to one or two additional forms of attack no matter
what its age, as given in its description.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Resistance (Ex):</span> As dragons age, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the variety descriptions.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Blindsense (Ex):</span>
Dragons can pinpoint creatures within a distance of 60 feet. Opponents
the dragon can&rsquo;t actually see still have total concealment
against the dragon.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Keen Senses (Ex): </span>A
dragon sees four times as well a human in shadowy illumination and
twice as well in normal light. It also has darkvision out to 120 feet.</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Skills:</span> All dragons
have skill points equal to (6 + Int modifier, minimum 1) x (Hit Dice +
3). Most dragons purchase the following skills at the maximum ranks
possible: Listen, Search, and Spot. The remaining skill points are
generally spent on Concentration, Diplomacy, Escape Artist, Intimidate,
Knowledge (any), Sense Motive, and Use Magic Device at a cost of 1
skill point per rank. All these skills are considered class skills for
dragons. (Each dragon has other class skills as well, as noted in the
variety descriptions.)</p>




      
      
      
      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats:</span> All dragons
have one feat, plus additional feats based on Hit Dice just like any
other creature. Dragons favor Alertness, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Flyby
Attack, Hover, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Power Attack,
Snatch, Weapon Focus (claw or bite), Wingover, and any metamagic feat
that is available and useful to sorcerers.</p>
