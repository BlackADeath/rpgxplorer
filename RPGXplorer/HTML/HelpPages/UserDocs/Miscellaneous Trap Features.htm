      <p>Some traps include optional features that can make them
considerably more deadly. The most common such features are discussed
below.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Alchemical Item:</span>
Mechanical traps may incorporate alchemical devices or other special
substances or items, such as tanglefoot bags, alchemist&rsquo;s fire,
thunderstones, and the like. Some such items mimic spell effects. If
the item mimics a spell effect, it increases the CR as shown on Table:
CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas:</span> With a gas trap,
the danger is in the inhaled poison it delivers. Traps employing gas
usually have the never miss and onset delay features (see below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Liquid:</span> Any trap that
involves a danger of drowning is in this category. Traps employing
liquid usually have the never miss and onset delay features (see
below).&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiple Target: </span>Traps with this feature can affect more than one character.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Never Miss:</span> When the
entire dungeon wall moves to crush you, your quick reflexes won&rsquo;t
help, since the wall can&rsquo;t possibly miss. A trap with this
feature has neither an attack bonus nor a saving throw to avoid, but it
does have an onset delay (see below). Most traps involving liquid or
gas are of the never miss variety.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Onset Delay:</span> An onset
delay is the amount of time between when the trap is sprung and when it
deals damage. A never miss trap always has an onset delay.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Poison:</span> Traps that
employ poison are deadlier than their nonpoisonous counterparts, so
they have correspondingly higher CRs. To determine the CR modifier for
a given poison, consult Table: CR Modifiers for Mechanical Traps. Only
injury, contact, and inhaled poisons are suitable for traps; ingested
types are not. Some traps simply deal the poison&rsquo;s damage. Others
deal damage with ranged or melee attacks as well.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pit Spikes:</span> Treat
spikes at the bottom of a pit as daggers, each with a +10 attack bonus.
The damage bonus for each spike is +1 per 10 feet of pit depth (to a
maximum of +5). Each character who falls into the pit is attacked by
1d4 spikes. Pit spikes do not add to the average damage of the trap
(see Average Damage, below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Pit Bottom:</span> If
something other than spikes waits at the bottom of a pit, it&rsquo;s
best to treat that as a separate trap (see Multiple Traps, below) with
a location trigger that activates on any significant impact, such as a
falling character.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch Attack:</span> This feature applies to any trap that needs only a successful touch attack (melee or ranged) to hit.
