      <p>A creature with this special quality ignores damage from most
weapons and natural attacks. Wounds heal immediately, or the weapon
bounces off harmlessly (in either case, the opponent knows the attack
was ineffective). The creature takes normal damage from energy attacks
(even nonmagical ones), spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural
abilities. A certain kind of weapon can sometimes damage the creature
normally, as noted below.</p>
      <p>The entry indicates the amount of damage ignored (usually 5 to 15 points) and the type of weapon that negates the ability.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to piercing, bludgeoning, or slashing damage.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to certain materials, such as
alchemical silver, adamantine, or cold-forged iron. Attacks from
weapons that are not made of the correct material have their damage
reduced, even if the weapon has an enhancement bonus.</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to magic weapons. Any weapon with
at least a +1 magical enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls
overcomes the damage reduction of these monsters. Such creatures&rsquo;
natural weapons (but not their attacks with weapons) are treated as
magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few very powerful monsters are vulnerable only to epic
weapons; that is, magic weapons with at least a +6 enhancement bonus.
Such creatures&rsquo; natural weapons are also treated as epic weapons
for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.</p>
      <p>Some monsters are vulnerable to chaotic-, evil-, good-, or lawful-aligned weapons. When a cleric casts <span style="font-style: italic;">align weapon</span>,
affected weapons might gain one or more of these properties, and
certain magic weapons have these properties as well. A creature with an
alignment subtype (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) can overcome this
type of damage reduction with its natural weapons and weapons it wields
as if the weapons or natural weapons had an alignment (or alignments)
that match the subtype(s) of the creature.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>When a damage reduction entry has a dash (&ndash;) after the slash, no weapon negates the damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few creatures are harmed by more than one kind of weapon. A weapon of either type overcomes this damage reduction.</p>
      <p>A few other creatures require combinations of different types
of attacks to overcome their damage reduction. A weapon must be both
types to overcome this damage reduction. A weapon that is only one type
is still subject to damage reduction.
