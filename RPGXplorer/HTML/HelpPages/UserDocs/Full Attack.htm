      <p>If you get more than one attack per round because your base
attack bonus is high enough, because you fight with two weapons or a
double weapon or for some special reason you must use a full-round
action to get your additional attacks. You do not need to specify the
targets of your attacks ahead of time. You can see how the earlier
attacks turn out before assigning the later ones.</p>
      <p>The only movement you can take during a full attack is a
5-foot step. You may take the step before, after, or between your
attacks.</p>
      <p>If you get multiple attacks because your base attack bonus is
high enough, you must make the attacks in order from highest bonus to
lowest. If you are using two weapons, you can strike with either weapon
first. If you are using a double weapon, you can strike with either
part of the weapon first.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deciding between an Attack or a Full Attack:</span>
After your first attack, you can decide to take a move action instead
of making your remaining attacks, depending on how the first attack
turns out. If you&rsquo;ve already taken a 5-foot step, you can&rsquo;t
use your move action to move any distance, but you could still use a
different kind of move action.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Fighting Defensively as a Full-Round Action:</span>
You can choose to fight defensively when taking a full attack action.
If you do so, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on all attacks in a round to
gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC for the same round.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Cleave:</span> The extra
attack granted by the Cleave feat or Great Cleave feat can be taken
whenever they apply. This is an exception to the normal limit to the
number of attacks you can take when not using a full attack action.
