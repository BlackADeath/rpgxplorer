      <p>Whenever you attempt an action that has some chance of
failure, you roll a twenty-sided die (d20). To determine if your
character succeeds at a task you do this:<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roll a d20.</li>
        <li>Add any relevant modifiers.</li>
        <li>Compare the result to a target number.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the result equals or exceeds the target number, your
character succeeds. If the result is lower than the target number, you
fail.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dice:</span> Dice rolls are
described with expressions such as &ldquo;3d4+3,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;roll three four-sided dice and add 3&rdquo; (resulting in a
number between 6 and 15). The first number tells you how many dice to
roll (adding the results together). The number immediately after the
&ldquo;d&rdquo; tells you the type of die to use. Any number after that
indicates a quantity that is added or subtracted from the result.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">d%:</span> Percentile dice work
a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by
rolling two different ten-sided dice. One (designated before you roll)
is the tens digit. The other is the ones digit. Two 0s represent 100.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rounding Fractions:</span> In general, if you wind up with a fraction, round down, even if the fraction is one-half or larger.<br>
Exception: Certain rolls, such as damage and hit points, have a minimum of 1.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Multiplying:</span> Sometimes a
rule makes you multiply a number or a die roll. As long as you&rsquo;re
applying a single multiplier, multiply the number normally. When two or
more multipliers apply to any abstract value (such as a modifier or a
die roll), however, combine them into a single multiple, with each
extra multiple adding 1 less than its value to the first multiple.
Thus, a double (&times;2) and a double (&times;2) applied to the same
number results in a triple (&times;3, because 2 + 1 = 3).<br>
      <br>
When applying multipliers to real-world values (such as weight or
distance), normal rules of math apply instead. A creature whose size
doubles (thus multiplying its weight by 8) and then is turned to stone
(which would multiply its weight by a factor of roughly 3) now weighs
about 24 times normal, not 10 times normal. Similarly, a blinded
creature attempting to negotiate difficult terrain would count each
square as 4 squares (doubling the cost twice, for a total multiplier of
&times;4), rather than as 3 squares (adding 100% twice).&nbsp;
