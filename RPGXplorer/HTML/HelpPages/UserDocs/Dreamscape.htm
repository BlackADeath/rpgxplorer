      <p>The character and any creatures he or she touches are drawn
into the region of dreams. The character can take more than one
creature along (subject to the character&rsquo;s weight limit), but all
must be touching each other. The character physically enters the land
of dreams, leaving nothing behind. For every minute the character moves
through the dream landscape, he or she can &ldquo;wake&rdquo; to find
him or her self five miles displaced in the waking world. The character
does not know precisely where he or she will come out in the waking
world, nor the conditions of the waking world through which the
character travels. The character knows approximately where he or she
will end up based on time spent traveling in dream. Dreamscape can also
be used to travel to other planes that contain creatures that dream,
but doing this requires crossing into the dreams of outsiders, where
the character is subject to the dangers of alien dream realities. This
is a potentially perilous proposition. Transferring to another plane of
existence requires 1d4 hours of uninterrupted journey. Any creatures
touched by the character when dreamscape is cast also make the
transition to the borders of unconscious thought. They may opt to
follow the character, wander off into the dreams of others, or stumble
back into the waking world (50% chance for either of the latter results
if they are lost or abandoned by the character). Creatures unwilling to
accompany the character into the region of dreams receive a Will save,
negating the effect if successful.&nbsp;</p>
