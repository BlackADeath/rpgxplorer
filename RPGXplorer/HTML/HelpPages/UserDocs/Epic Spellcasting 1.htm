      <p>Once an epic spell is developed, the caster knows the spell. A
developed epic spell becomes an indelible part of the caster and may be
prepared without a spellbook (if a wizard is the caster). Characters
who cast spells spontaneously, such as sorcerers, can cast a developed
epic spell by using any open epic spell slot. Druids, clerics, and
similar spellcasters can likewise prepare epic spells using epic spell
slots. </p>
      <p>A spellcaster can prepare or cast any epic spell he or she
knows as many times per day as he or she has available epic spell
slots. A spellcaster who can cast epic spells has a number of open epic
spell slots per day equal to one-tenth his or her ranks in the
Knowledge skill appropriate to the spell and the caster&rsquo;s class.
Knowledge (arcana) is appropriate for arcane casters, and Knowledge
(religion) or Knowledge (nature) is appropriate for divine casters. The
rules for rest between casting a day&rsquo;s allotment of epic spells
are the same as for rest required to prepare standard spells. If the
caster doesn&rsquo;t use up a day&rsquo;s allotment of epic spell
slots, the unused slots remain available whether or not the spellcaster
receives appropriate rest. </p>
      <p>Even if the epic spell has been developed and an epic spell
slot is available, successfully casting an epic spell isn&rsquo;t
assured. The caster&rsquo;s Spellcraft skill modifier is vital for
casting an epic spell. To cast an epic spell, a spellcaster makes a
Spellcraft check against the epic spell&rsquo;s Spellcraft DC. If the
check succeeds, the spell is cast. If the caster fails the check, the
epic spell fizzles and the epic spell slot is used for the day. </p>
      <p>Because epic spells require Spellcraft checks, a spell is
beyond the caster&rsquo;s ability if the final Spellcraft DC is greater
than 20 + the spellcaster&rsquo;s Spellcraft modifier. Epic spells with
DCs higher than 10 + the spellcaster&rsquo;s Spellcraft modifier are
risky; a caster can take 10 when casting an epic spell, but he or she
can&rsquo;t take 20. When routinely casting epic spells, most
spellcasters take 10 on their Spellcraft checks. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Epic Spell Levels: </span>Epic
spells have no fixed level. However, for purposes of Concentration
checks, spell resistance, and other possible situations where spell
level is important, epic spells are all treated as if they were
10th-level spells. </p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Metamagic, Items, and Epic Spells: </span>Metamagic feats and other epic feats that manipulate normal spells cannot be used with epic spells. </p>
      <p>A character can&rsquo;t craft a magic item that casts an epic
spell, regardless of whether the item is activated with spell
completion, a spell trigger, a command word, or simple use. Only major
artifacts, which are beyond the means of even epic characters to
create, can possibly contain magic of this power. </p>
      <p>The saving throw against a character&rsquo;s epic spell has a
DC of 20 + the character&rsquo;s relevant ability score modifier.
It&rsquo;s possible to develop epic spells that have even higher DCs,
however, by applying the appropriate factor. </p>
