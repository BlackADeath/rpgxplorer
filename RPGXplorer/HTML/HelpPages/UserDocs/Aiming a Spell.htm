      <p>You must make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or
where the effect is to originate, depending on the type of spell. The
next entry in a spell description defines the spell&rsquo;s target (or
targets), its effect, or its area, as appropriate.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Target or Targets: </span>Some
spells have a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or
objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or
touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do
not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.</p>
      <p>If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description
has a line that reads Target: You), you do not receive a saving throw,
and spell resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and Spell
Resistance lines are omitted from such spells.</p>
      <p>Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring
yourself as a willing target is something that can be done at any time
(even if you&rsquo;re flat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your turn).
Unconscious creatures are automatically considered willing, but a
character who is conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is
bound, cowering, grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not
automatically willing.</p>
      <p>Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or
areas after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action
that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> Some spells create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.</p>
      <p>You must designate the location where these things are to
appear, either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far
away an effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can move
regardless of the spell&rsquo;s range.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Ray:</span> Some effects are
rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you
make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with
a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature
and hope you hit something. You don&rsquo;t have to see the creature
you&rsquo;re trying to hit, as you do with a targeted spell.
Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of
sight or provide cover for the creature you&rsquo;re aiming at.</p>
      <p>If a ray spell has a duration, it&rsquo;s the duration of the
effect that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself
persists.</p>
      <p>If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just
as if it were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a
natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Spread:</span> Some effects,
notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must
be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into
areas that you can&rsquo;t see. Figure distance by actual distance
traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When
determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not
through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners.
You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need
not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> Some spells
affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a specially
defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the categories
defined below.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point
where the spell originates, but otherwise you don&rsquo;t control which
creatures or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell
is always a grid intersection. When determining whether a given
creature is within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the
point of origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or
when determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is
that instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of
the next, you count from intersection to intersection.</p>
      <p>You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that
every second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge
of a square is within the spell&rsquo;s area, anything within that
square is within the spell&rsquo;s area. If the spell&rsquo;s area only
touches the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square
is unaffected by the spell.<br>
Burst, Emanation, or Spread: Most spells that affect an area function
as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the
spell&rsquo;s point of origin and measure its effect from that point.</p>
      <p>A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even
including creatures that you can&rsquo;t see. It can&rsquo;t affect
creatures with total cover from its point of origin (in other words,
its effects don&rsquo;t extend around corners). The default shape for a
burst effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are specifically
described as cone-shaped. A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the
point of origin the spell&rsquo;s effect extends.</p>
      <p>An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that
the effect continues to radiate from the point of origin for the
duration of the spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.</p>
      <p>A spread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners.
You select the point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given
distance in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by
taking into account any turns the spell effect takes.</p>
      <p>Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere: Most spells that affect an
area have a particular shape, such as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.</p>
      <p>A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle
in the direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your
square and widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or
emanations (see above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around corners.</p>
      <p>When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the
spell&rsquo;s point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal
circle, and the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder.
A cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions within its area.</p>
      <p>A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the
direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and
extends to the limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that
blocks line of effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in
squares that the line passes through.</p>
      <p>A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Creatures:</span> A spell
with this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted
spell), but it affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather
than individual creatures you select. The area might be a spherical
burst , a cone-shaped burst, or some other shape.</p>
      <p>Many spells affect &ldquo;living creatures,&rdquo; which means
all creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in the
spell&rsquo;s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count
against the creatures affected.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Objects:</span> A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but affecting objects instead).</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Other:</span> A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">(S) Shapeable:</span> If an
Area or Effect entry ends with &ldquo;(S),&rdquo; you can shape the
spell. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10
feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it easy to model
irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to
define aerial or underwater effects and areas.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Line of Effect:</span> A line
of effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can
affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It&rsquo;s
like line of sight for ranged weapons, except that it&rsquo;s not
blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight.</p>
      <p>You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you
cast a spell on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect.
You must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any
spell you cast.</p>
      <p>A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an
area, creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from its
origin (a spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped
burst&rsquo;s starting point, a cylinder&rsquo;s circle, or an
emanation&rsquo;s point of origin).</p>
      <p>An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square
foot through it does not block a spell&rsquo;s line of effect. Such an
opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no
longer considered a barrier for purposes of a spell&rsquo;s line of
effect.
