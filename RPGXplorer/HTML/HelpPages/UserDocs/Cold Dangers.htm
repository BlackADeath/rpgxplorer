      <p>Cold and exposure deal nonlethal damage to the victim. This
nonlethal damage cannot be recovered until the character gets out of
the cold and warms up again. Once a character is rendered unconscious
through the accumulation of nonlethal damage, the cold and exposure
begins to deal lethal damage at the same rate.</p>
      <p>An unprotected character in cold weather (below 40&deg; F)
must make a Fortitude save each hour (DC 15, + 1 per previous check) or
take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage. A character who has the Survival
skill may receive a bonus on this saving throw and may be able to apply
this bonus to other characters as well (see the skill Description).</p>
      <p>In conditions of severe cold or exposure (below 0&deg; F), an
unprotected character must make a Fortitude save once every 10 minutes
(DC 15, +1 per previous check), taking 1d6 points of nonlethal damage
on each failed save. A character who has the Survival skill may receive
a bonus on this saving throw and may be able to apply this bonus to
other characters as well (see the skill description). Characters
wearing winter clothing only need check once per hour for cold and
exposure damage.</p>
      <p>A character who takes any nonlethal damage from cold or
exposure is beset by frostbite or hypothermia (treat her as fatigued).
These penalties end when the character recovers the nonlethal damage
she took from the cold and exposure.</p>
      <p>Extreme cold (below -20&deg; F) deals 1d6 points of lethal
damage per minute (no save). In addition, a character must make a
Fortitude save (DC 15, +1 per previous check) or take 1d4 points of
nonlethal damage. Those wearing metal armor or coming into contact with
very cold metal are affected as if by a chill metal spell.</p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Ice Effects</p>
      <p>Characters walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to
enter a square covered by ice, and the DC for Balance and Tumble checks
increases by +5. Characters in prolonged contact with ice may run the
risk of taking damage from severe cold (see above).
