      <p>The standard advancement rules allow dragons theoretically
infinite progression even beyond the stage of great wyrm. The following
rules let dragons improve more than their Hit Dice as they progress to
epic heights of power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Age Category:</span> A
standard dragon gains one &ldquo;virtual age category&rdquo; for every
3 Hit Dice it gains beyond the great wyrm stage. Abilities that
function once per day per age category or otherwise use the
dragon&rsquo;s age category as part of a calculation use this adjusted
number. Epic dragons gain one age category per 5 Hit Dice beyond great
wyrm.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Size:</span> One important
element of dragon advancement is increasing size. The dragons that
don&rsquo;t reach Colossal size by the great wyrm stage can never reach
it according to the standard advancement rules. When advancing a
dragon, consider its basic size group: lesser (white, black, brass, and
copper dragons), ordinary (green, blue, and bronze dragons), greater
(silver, red, and gold), or epic (force and prismatic). A dragon that
is Tiny as a wyrmling is in the lesser group, a dragon that is Small as
a wyrmling and never reaches Colossal size is in the ordinary group,
and a dragon that is Small to Large as a wyrmling and reaches Colossal
by the great wyrm stage is in the greater group. A lesser dragon
becomes Colossal when it gains two age categories (6 Hit Dice) beyond
great wyrm. It increases to Colossal+ when it gains an additional four
age categories (12 HD). An ordinary dragon becomes Colossal when it
gains one age category (3 Hit Dice) beyond great wyrm. It increases to
Colossal+ when it gains an additional four age categories (12 HD). A
greater dragon becomes Colossal+ when it gains four age categories (12
HD) more than it needed to reach the Colossal size. </p>
      <p>Epic dragons, already Colossal+ by the time they reach the
great wyrm stage, do not increase in size thereafter. Use the
information presented under the epic dragon entry, below, to determine
the statistics of a Colossal+ dragon.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Class:</span> A
dragon&rsquo;s natural armor bonus increases by +1 for every Hit Die it
gains beyond the great wyrm stage. (This rule applies for lesser dragon
advancement as well, since natural armor and Hit Dice always increase
at the same rate.)</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Breath Weapon:</span> If a
dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon deals damage, the damage typically
increases by 2 dice for every virtual age category the dragon gains.
The two exceptions among standard dragons are the brass and white
dragons, whose breath weapon damage increases by only 1 die per age
category. The saving throw DC against a dragon&rsquo;s breath weapon
remains 10 + 1/2 the dragon&rsquo;s Hit Dice + its Constitution
modifier.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Resistance:</span> For
standard advanced dragons, spell resistance increases by 2 per
additional age category. For epic dragons, spell resistance increases
by 3 (for force dragons) or 6 (for prismatic dragons) per additional
age category.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Speed:</span> When a dragon
becomes Colossal, its fly speed increases by 50 feet and its
maneuverability becomes clumsy. When it reaches Colossal+, its fly
speed increases by another 50 feet, and its maneuverability remains
clumsy. A dragon&rsquo;s land speed and other special movement types
(swim, burrow, and so on) do not change.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Scores:</span> A
great wyrm&rsquo;s Strength and Constitution scores both increase by +2
for every virtual age category the dragon gains. Its Dexterity remains
unchanged. Its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma increase by +2 for
every two age categories the dragon gains.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Special Abilities:</span>
Dragons do not gain additional spell-like abilities, but their damage
reduction continues to increase as they gain Hit Dice. For most dragons
(the exceptions being the force and prismatic dragons), the great
wyrm&rsquo;s damage reduction increases to 15/epic after exceeding the
great wyrm age category and the dragon&rsquo;s natural weapons count as
epic weapons for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction.</p>
      <p>Force and prismatic dragons have the following DR progression:
wyrmling 10/magic, young 15/magic, young adult 15/epic, mature adult
20/epic, very old 25/epic.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caster Level:</span> A great
wyrm&rsquo;s caster level increases by 2 for every virtual age category
the dragon gains. As with the epic dragons described later, advanced
dragons gain the Improved Spell Capacity feat as a bonus feat once for
every three caster levels above 20th.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Feats:</span> Like ordinary
dragons, advanced dragons receive one feat for every 3 Hit Dice they
have. Feats gained after the dragon attains great wyrm status can be
epic feats.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span> For
standard dragons, CR increases by 2 per additional age category. For
epic dragons, CR increases by 3 per additional age category. All other
dragon statistics are as presented for dragons in general and specific
dragon varieties. </p>
