      <p>If a creature with this special attack hits with a melee
weapon (usually a claw or bite attack), it deals normal damage and
attempts to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an
attack of opportunity. No initial touch attack is required. Unless
otherwise noted, improved grab works only against opponents at least
one size category smaller than the creature. The creature has the
option to conduct the grapple normally, or simply use the part of its
body it used in the improved grab to hold the opponent. If it chooses
to do the latter, it takes a &ndash;20 penalty on grapple checks, but
is not considered grappled itself; the creature does not lose its
Dexterity bonus to AC, still threatens an area, and can use its
remaining attacks against other opponents. A successful hold does not
deal any extra damage unless the creature also has the constrict
special attack. If the creature does not constrict, each successful
grapple check it makes during successive rounds automatically deals the
damage indicated for the attack that established the hold. Otherwise,
it deals constriction damage as well (the amount is given in the
creature&rsquo;s descriptive text). When a creature gets a hold after
an improved grab attack, it pulls the opponent into its space. This act
does not provoke attacks of opportunity. It can even move (possibly
carrying away the opponent), provided it can drag the opponent&rsquo;s
weight.&nbsp; </p>
