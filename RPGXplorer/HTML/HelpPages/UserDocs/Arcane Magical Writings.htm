      <p>To record an arcane spell in written form, a character uses
complex notation that describes the magical forces involved in the
spell. The writer uses the same system no matter what her native
language or culture. However, each character uses the system in her own
way. Another person&rsquo;s magical writing remains incomprehensible to
even the most powerful wizard until she takes time to study and
decipher it.</p>
      <p>To decipher an arcane magical writing (such as a single spell
in written form in another&rsquo;s spellbook or on a scroll), a
character must make a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + the spell&rsquo;s
level). If the skill check fails, the character cannot attempt to read
that particular spell again until the next day. A read magic spell
automatically deciphers a magical writing without a skill check. If the
person who created the magical writing is on hand to help the reader,
success is also automatic.</p>
      <p>Once a character deciphers a particular magical writing, she
does not need to decipher it again. Deciphering a magical writing
allows the reader to identify the spell and gives some idea of its
effects (as explained in the spell description). If the magical writing
was a scroll and the reader can cast arcane spells, she can attempt to
use the scroll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Wizard Spells and Borrowed Spellbooks:</span>
A wizard can use a borrowed spellbook to prepare a spell she already
knows and has recorded in her own spellbook, but preparation success is
not assured. First, the wizard must decipher the writing in the book
(see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Once a spell from another
spellcaster&rsquo;s book is deciphered, the reader must make a
Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell&rsquo;s level) to prepare the spell. If
the check succeeds, the wizard can prepare the spell. She must repeat
the check to prepare the spell again, no matter how many times she has
prepared it before. If the check fails, she cannot try to prepare the
spell from the same source again until the next day. (However, as
explained above, she does not need to repeat a check to decipher the
writing.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Adding Spells to a Wizard&rsquo;s Spellbook: </span>Wizards
can add new spells to their spellbooks through several methods. If a
wizard has chosen to specialize in a school of magic, she can learn
spells only from schools whose spells she can cast.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spells Gained at a New Level:</span>
Wizards perform a certain amount of spell research between adventures.
Each time a character attains a new wizard level, she gains two spells
of her choice to add to her spellbook. The two free spells must be of
spell levels she can cast. If she has chosen to specialize in a school
of magic, one of the two free spells must be from her specialty school.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spells Copied from Another&rsquo;s Spellbook or a Scroll:</span>
A wizard can also add a spell to her book whenever she encounters one
on a magic scroll or in another wizard&rsquo;s spellbook. No matter
what the spell&rsquo;s source, the wizard must first decipher the
magical writing (see Arcane Magical Writings, above). Next, she must
spend a day studying the spell. At the end of the day, she must make a
Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell&rsquo;s level). A wizard who has
specialized in a school of spells gains a +2 bonus on the Spellcraft
check if the new spell is from her specialty school. She cannot,
however, learn any spells from her prohibited schools. If the check
succeeds, the wizard understands the spell and can copy it into her
spellbook (see Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, below). The
process leaves a spellbook that was copied from unharmed, but a spell
successfully copied from a magic scroll disappears from the parchment.</p>
      <p>If the check fails, the wizard cannot understand or copy the
spell. She cannot attempt to learn or copy that spell again until she
gains another rank in Spellcraft. A spell that was being copied from a
scroll does not vanish from the scroll.</p>
      <p>In most cases, wizards charge a fee for the privilege of
copying spells from their spellbooks. This fee is usually equal to the
spell&rsquo;s level x 50 gp.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Independent Research:</span> A wizard also can research a spell independently, duplicating an existing spell or creating an entirely new one.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook:</span> Once a wizard understands a new spell, she can record it into her spellbook.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time:</span> The process takes 24 hours, regardless of the spell&rsquo;s level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Space in the Spellbook:</span>
A spell takes up one page of the spellbook per spell level. Even a
0-level spell (cantrip) takes one page. A spellbook has one hundred
pages.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Materials and Costs:</span> Materials for writing the spell cost 100 gp per page.</p>
      <p>Note that a wizard does not have to pay these costs in time or gold for the spells she gains for free at each new level.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Replacing and Copying Spellbooks: </span>A
wizard can use the procedure for learning a spell to reconstruct a lost
spellbook. If she already has a particular spell prepared, she can
write it directly into a new book at a cost of 100 gp per page (as
noted in Writing a New Spell into a Spellbook, above). The process
wipes the prepared spell from her mind, just as casting it would. If
she does not have the spell prepared, she can prepare it from a
borrowed spellbook and then write it into a new book.</p>
      <p>Duplicating an existing spellbook uses the same procedure as
replacing it, but the task is much easier. The time requirement and
cost per page are halved.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Selling a Spellbook:</span>
Captured spellbooks can be sold for a gp amount equal to one-half the
cost of purchasing and inscribing the spells within (that is, one-half
of 100 gp per page of spells). A spellbook entirely filled with spells
(that is, with one hundred pages of spells inscribed in it) is worth
5,000 gp.
