      <p>The Plane of Shadow is a dimly lit dimension that is both
coterminous to and coexistent with the Material Plane. It overlaps the
Material Plane much as the Ethereal Plane does, so a planar traveler
can use the Plane of Shadow to cover great distances quickly.</p>
      <p>The Plane of Shadow is also coterminous to other planes. With
the right spell, a character can use the Plane of Shadow to visit other
realities.</p>
      <p>The Plane of Shadow is a world of black and white; color
itself has been bleached from the environment. It is otherwise appears
similar to the Material Plane.</p>
      <p>Despite the lack of light sources, various plants, animals, and humanoids call the Plane of Shadow home.</p>
      <p>The Plane of Shadow is magically morphic, and parts
continually flow onto other planes. As a result, creating a precise map
of the plane is next to impossible, despite the presence of landmarks.</p>
      <p>The Plane of Shadow has the following traits.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Magically morphic. Certain spells modify the base material
of the Plane of Shadow. The utility and power of these spells within
the Plane of Shadow make them particularly useful for explorers and
natives alike.</li>
        <li>Mildly neutral-aligned.</li>
        <li>Enhanced magic. Spells with the shadow descriptor are
enhanced on the Plane of Shadow. Such spells are cast as though they
were prepared with the Maximize Spell feat, though they don&rsquo;t
require the higher spell slots.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, specific spells become more powerful on the Plane
of Shadow. Shadow conjuration and shadow evocation spells are 30% as
powerful as the conjurations and evocations they mimic (as opposed to
20%). Greater shadow conjuration and greater shadow evocation are 70%
as powerful (not 60%), and a shades spell conjures at 90% of the power
of the original (not 80%).<br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Impeded magic. Spells that use or generate light or fire
may fizzle when cast on the Plane of Shadow. A spellcaster attempting a
spell with the light or fire descriptor must succeed on a Spellcraft
check (DC 20 + the level of the spell). Spells that produce light are
less effective in general, because all light sources have their ranges
halved on the Plane of Shadow.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Despite the dark nature of the Plane of Shadow, spells that produce, use, or manipulate darkness are unaffected by the plane.
