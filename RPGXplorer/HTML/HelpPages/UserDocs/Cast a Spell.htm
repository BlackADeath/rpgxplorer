      <p>Most spells require 1 standard action to cast. You can cast such a spell either before or after you take a move action.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Note</span>: You retain your Dexterity bonus to AC while casting.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Components:</span> To
cast a spell with a verbal (V) component, your character must speak in
a firm voice. If you&rsquo;re gagged or in the area of a silence spell,
you can&rsquo;t cast such a spell. A spellcaster who has been deafened
has a 20% chance to spoil any spell he tries to cast if that spell has
a verbal component.</p>
      <p>To cast a spell with a somatic (S) component, you must gesture
freely with at least one hand. You can&rsquo;t cast a spell of this
type while bound, grappling, or with both your hands full or occupied.</p>
      <p>To cast a spell with a material (M), focus (F), or divine
focus (DF) component, you have to have the proper materials, as
described by the spell. Unless these materials are elaborate preparing
these materials is a free action. For material components and focuses
whose costs are not listed, you can assume that you have them if you
have your spell component pouch.</p>
      <p>Some spells have an experience point (XP) component and entail
an experience point cost to you. No spell can restore the lost XP. You
cannot spend so much XP that you lose a level, so you cannot cast the
spell unless you have enough XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining
enough XP to achieve a new level, immediately spend the XP on casting
the spell rather than keeping it to advance a level. The XP are
expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentration:</span> You
must concentrate to cast a spell. If you can&rsquo;t concentrate you
can&rsquo;t cast a spell. If you start casting a spell but something
interferes with your concentration you must make a Concentration check
or lose the spell. The check&rsquo;s DC depends on what is threatening
your concentration (see the Concentration skill). If you fail, the
spell fizzles with no effect. If you prepare spells, it is lost from
preparation. If you cast at will, it counts against your daily limit of
spells even though you did not cast it successfully.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentrating to Maintain a Spell:</span>
Some spells require continued concentration to keep them going.
Concentrating to maintain a spell is a standard action that
doesn&rsquo;t provoke an attack of opportunity. Anything that could
break your concentration when casting a spell can keep you from
concentrating to maintain a spell. If your concentration breaks, the
spell ends.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time: </span>Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. A spell cast in this manner immediately takes effect.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Attacks of Opportunity:</span>
Generally, if you cast a spell, you provoke attacks of opportunity from
threatening enemies. If you take damage from an attack of opportunity,
you must make a Concentration check (DC 10 + points of damage taken +
spell level) or lose the spell. Spells that require only a free action
to cast don&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting on the Defensive:</span>
Casting a spell while on the defensive does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. It does, however, require a Concentration check (DC 15 +
spell level) to pull off. Failure means that you lose the spell.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch Spells in Combat:</span>
Many spells have a range of touch. To use these spells, you cast the
spell and then touch the subject, either in the same round or any time
later. In the same round that you cast the spell, you may also touch
(or attempt to touch) the target. You may take your move before casting
the spell, after touching the target, or between casting the spell and
touching the target. You can automatically touch one friend or use the
spell on yourself, but to touch an opponent, you must succeed on an
attack roll.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Touch Attacks</span>:
Touching an opponent with a touch spell is considered to be an armed
attack and therefore does not provoke attacks of opportunity. However,
the act of casting a spell does provoke an attack of opportunity. Touch
attacks come in two types: melee touch attacks and ranged touch
attacks. You can score critical hits with either type of attack. Your
opponent&rsquo;s AC against a touch attack does not include any armor
bonus, shield bonus, or natural armor bonus. His size modifier,
Dexterity modifier, and deflection bonus (if any) all apply normally.</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Holding the Charge</span>:
If you don&rsquo;t discharge the spell in the round when you cast the
spell, you can hold the discharge of the spell (hold the charge)
indefinitely. You can continue to make touch attacks round after round.
You can touch one friend as a standard action or up to six friends as a
full-round action. If you touch anything or anyone while holding a
charge, even unintentionally, the spell discharges. If you cast another
spell, the touch spell dissipates. Alternatively, you may make a normal
unarmed attack (or an attack with a natural weapon) while holding a
charge. In this case, you aren&rsquo;t considered armed and you provoke
attacks of opportunity as normal for the attack. (If your unarmed
attack or natural weapon attack doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of
opportunity, neither does this attack.) If the attack hits, you deal
normal damage for your unarmed attack or natural weapon and the spell
discharges. If the attack misses, you are still holding the charge.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Dismiss a Spell:</span> Dismissing an active spell is a standard action that doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.
