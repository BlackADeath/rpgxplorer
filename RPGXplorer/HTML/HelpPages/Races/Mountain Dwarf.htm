  <tbody>



    <tr>



      <td class="HelpText" valign="top">Mountain dwarves live
deeper under the mountains than hill dwarves but generally not as far
underground as deep dwarves. They average about 4-1/2 feet tall and
have lighter skin and hair than hill dwarves, but the same general
appearance.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;" lang="EN-US"></span>+2 Constitution, -2 Charisma.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Medium:</span> As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br>



      <br>



Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this
speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium
or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such
situations).<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Darkvision:</span> Dwarves can
see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but
it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine
with no light at all.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stonecunning:</span> This
ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice
unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new
construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces,
shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn't stone but that
is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who
merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search
check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search
skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit
depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a
human can sense which way is up.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapon Familiarity:</span> Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stability: </span>A dwarf gains
a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or
tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying,
riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).<br>



      <br>



+2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.<br>



      <br>



+2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.<br>



      <br>



+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs and goblinoids.<br>



      <br>



+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against monsters of the giant type. Any
time a creature loses its Dexterity bonus (if any) to Armor Class, such
as when it's caught flat-footed, it loses its dodge bonus, too.<br>



      <br>



+2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.<br>



      <br>



+2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic Languages:</span> Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Giant, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Terran, and Undercommon.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Favored Class:</span> Fighter. A
multiclass dwarf 's fighter class does not count when determining
whether he takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing&nbsp;</td>
