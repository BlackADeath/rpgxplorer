				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Also called deep gnomes, svirfneblin are said to dwell in great cities deep underground.<br>
      <br>
A svirfneblin has wiry, rock-colored skin usually medium brown to
brownish gray. Only males are bald; females have stringy gray hair. The
average svirfneblin lifespan is 250 years.<br>
      <br>
Svirfneblin speak Gnome, Common, and Undercommon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Svirfneblin Traits (Ex):</span> These traits are in addition to the rock gnome traits, except where noted.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>&ndash;2 Strength, +2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, &ndash;4
Charisma. These adjustments replace the rock gnome&rsquo;s ability
score adjustments.</li>
        <li>Stonecunning: This ability grants deep gnomes a +2 racial
bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework. A deep gnome who
merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search
check as though actively searching, and can use the Search skill to
find stonework traps as a rogue can. A svirfneblin can also intuit
depth, sensing the approximate distance underground as naturally as a
human can sense which way is up.</li>
        <li>Darkvision out to 120 feet and low-light vision.</li>
        <li>Spell resistance equal to 11 + class levels.</li>
        <li>+2 racial bonus on all saving throws (figured into the
statistics for the character presented here). This trait replaces the
rock gnome&rsquo;s racial bonus on saving throws against illusions.</li>
        <li>Add +1 to the Difficulty Class for all saving throws
against illusion spells cast by svirfneblin. This adjustment stacks
with those from similar effects, such as the Spell Focus feat.</li>
        <li>+1 racial bonus on attack rolls against kobolds and goblinoids. </li>
        <li>+4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against all creatures
(figured into the statistics for the character presented here). This
trait replaces the rock gnome&rsquo;s dodge bonus against giants.</li>
        <li>Automatic Languages: Undercommon, Gnome, Common. Bonus
Languages: Dwarven, Elven, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran. This trait
replaces the rock gnome&rsquo;s automatic and bonus languages.</li>
        <li>Spell-Like Abilities: 1/day&mdash;blindness/deafness
(typical save DC 13), blur, disguise self. Caster level equals the
svirfneblin&rsquo;s class levels. The save DC is Charisma-based and
include a +4 racial modifier. This trait replaces the rock
gnome&rsquo;s spell-like abilities.</li>
        <li>Nondetection (Su): A svirfneblin has a continuous nondetection ability as the spell (caster level equal to class levels).</li>
        <li>+2 racial bonus on Craft (alchemy) and Listen checks.</li>

        <li>Favored Class: Rogue.</li>
        <li>Level adjustment +3.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Challenge Rating:</span>

character level. Svirfneblin with levels in PC classes have a CR equal
to their character level +1.<br>
