      <td class="HelpText" valign="top">
      <ul>
        <li>+2 Charisma, &ndash;2 Strength, &ndash;2 Wisdom</li>
        <li>Monstrous Humanoid: Dromites are not subject to spells or
effects that affect humanoids only, such as charm person or dominate
person.</li>
        <li>Small: As a Small creature, a dromite gains a +1 size bonus
to Armor Class, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, and a +4 size bonus on
Hide checks, but it uses smaller weapons than humans use, and its
lifting and carrying limits are three-quarters of those of a Medium
character.</li>
        <li>Dromite base land speed is 20 feet.</li>
        <li>Chitin: A dromite&rsquo;s skin is hardened, almost like an
exoskeleton, and grants the character a +3 natural armor bonus to AC
and one of the following kinds of resistance to energy: cold 5,
electricity 5, fire 5, or sonic 5. The player chooses what type of
energy resistance is gained when the character is created. (This choice
also dictates which caste the dromite belongs to.) This natural energy
resistance stacks with any future energy resistance gained through
other effects.</li>
        <li>Naturally Psionic: Dromites gain 1 bonus power point at 1st
level. This benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers
unless they gain that ability through another source, such as levels in
a psionic class.</li>
        <li>Psi-Like Ability: 1/day - <span style="font-style: italic;">energy ray.</span>
A dromite always deals the kind of energy damage that its chitin has
resistance to (for example, a dromite who has resistance to cold 5
deals cold damage with its <span style="font-style: italic;">energy ray</span>). Manifester level is equal to 1/2 Hit Dice (minimum 1st). The save DC is Charisma-based.</li>
        <li>Scent: Its antennae give a dromite the scent ability. A
dromite can detect opponents by scent within 30 feet. If the opponent
is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15
feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected
at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk
musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When
a dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not re
vealed - only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take
a move action to note the direction of the scent. Whenever the dromite
comes within 5 feet of the source, the dromite pinpoints the
source&rsquo;s location.</li>
        <li>Blind-Fight: Its antennae also give a dromite Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.</li>
        <li>Compound Eyes: This feature of its anatomy gives a dromite a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks.</li>
        <li>Automatic Languages: Common. Bonus Languages: Dwarven, Gnome, Goblin, Terran.</li>
        <li>Favored Class: Wilder.</li>
        <li>Level Adjustment: +1.</li>
      </ul>
