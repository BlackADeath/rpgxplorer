      <p>Psychoactive skins (also sometimes called ectoshells) are
fistsized globs of psionically charged ectoplasm. As a standard action,
a psychoactive skin spreads over and covers a Medium or smaller
creature that projects the proper command thought; the same command
thought causes the skin to shrink back down to its former size. Each of
the various psychoactive skins is charged with one of a wide array of
powers that constantly affect the wearer.</p>

      
      <p>A deployed skin completely covers the wearer and all his
equipment like a second skin, allowing the wearer to see, hear, and
breathe normally. It rolls away from various parts of the body as
needed, such as when the wearer needs to eat or access a backpack. Held
items or items specifically excluded are not covered by a psychoactive
skin.</p>

      
      <p>Up to three skins can be worn simultaneously, although only
the outermost is active in any given round (the powers of hidden skins
cannot be manifested). Skin layers can be changed with a command
thought as a standard action, which causes a lower-layer skin to come
to the surface.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Skin of the Chameleon:</span>
This psychoactive skin adjusts to surrounding textures and colors,
continually granting the wearer a +10 enhancement bonus on Hide checks.</p>

      
      <p>Faint psychometabolism; ML 3rd; Craft Universal Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">chameleon;</span> Price 18,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Skin of the Claw:</span>
This psychoactive skin benefits only a wearer who has levels in psychic
warrior. If such a character wears this skin, he can activate the <span style="font-style: italic;">claws of the beast</span> power at will, as a free action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. He can also dismiss the claws equally quickly.</p>

      
      <p>Faint psychometabolism; ML 4th; Craft Universal Item,<span style="font-style: italic;"> claws of the beast; </span>Price 16,000 gp; Weight 2 lb.</p>

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Skin of Fiery Response: </span>This
psychoactive skin answers the first attack made against the wearer in
each round with an automatically manifested and targeted
&ldquo;ectoburst&rdquo; against the attacker. The burst ejects from the
skin on the wearer&rsquo;s turn, making a ranged touch attack as
described in the<span style="font-style: italic;"> energy retort</span>
power, but the energy type chosen is always fire. If the attack hits,
the target takes 2d6 points of fire damage as the ectoburst flames up
and is consumed. This attack does not in any way hinder the wearer,
count against her total actions for the round, or provoke attacks of
opportunity.</p>

power up to three times per day for 15 minutes with each use. When the

      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Skin of Proteus: </span>This psychoactive skin continually affects the wearer as the <span style="font-style: italic;">metamorphosis</span> power. While in a form other than his natural form, the wearer does not appear to be wearing the skin.</p>
