      <p>Clairsentience powers enable you to learn secrets long
forgotten, to glimpse the immediate future and predict the far future,
to find hidden objects, and to know what is normally unknowable.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of psionics - magic transparency,
clairsentience powers are equivalent to powers of the divination school
(thus, creatures immune to divination spells are also immune to
clairsentience powers).</p>
      <p>Many clairsentience powers have cone-shaped areas. These move
with you and extend in the direction you look. The cone defines the
area that you can sweep each round. If you study the same area for
multiple rounds, you can often gain additional information, as noted in
the descriptive text for the power.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Scrying:</span> A power of
the scrying subdiscipline creates an invisible sensor that sends you
information. Unless noted otherwise, the sensor has the same powers of
sensory acuity that you possess. This includes any powers or effects
that target you, but not powers or effects that emanate from you.
However, the sensor is treated as a separate, independent sensory organ
of yours, and thus functions normally even if you have been blinded,
deafened, or otherwise suffered sensory impairment. Any creature with
an Intelligence score of 12 or higher can notice the sensor by making a
DC 20 Intelligence check. The sensor can be dispelled as if it were an
active power. Lead sheeting or psionic protection blocks scrying
powers, and you sense that the power is so blocked.</p>
