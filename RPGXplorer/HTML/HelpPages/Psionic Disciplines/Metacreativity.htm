      <p>Metacreativity powers create objects, creatures, or some form
of matter. Creatures you create usually, but not always, obey your
commands.</p>
      <p>A metacreativity power draws raw ectoplasm from the Astral
Plane to create an object or creature in the place the psionic
character designates (subject to the limits noted above). Objects
created in this fashion are as solid and durable as normal objects,
despite their originally diaphanous substance. Psionic creatures
created with metacreativity powers are considered constructs, not
outsiders.</p>
      <p>A creature or object brought into being cannot appear inside
another creature or object, nor can it appear floating in an empty
space. It must arrive in an open location on a surface capable of
supporting it. The creature or object must appear within the
power&rsquo;s range, but it does not have to remain within the range.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of psionics - magic transparency,
metacreativity powers are equivalent to powers of the conjuration
school (thus, creatures immune to conjuration spells are also immune to
metacreativity powers).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Creation:</span> A power of
the creation subdiscipline creates an object or creature in the place
the manifester designates (subject to the limits noted above). If the
power has a duration other than instantaneous, psionic energy holds the
creation together, and when the power ends, the created creature or
object vanishes without a trace, except for a thin film of glistening
ectoplasm that quickly evaporates. If the power has an instantaneous
duration, the created object or creature is merely assembled through
psionics. It lasts indefinitely and does not depend on psionics for its
existence.</p>
