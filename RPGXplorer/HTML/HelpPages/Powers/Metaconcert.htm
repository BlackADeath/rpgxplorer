				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Telepathy [Mind-Affecting]<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Psychic warrior 5, telepath 5<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Visual; see text<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 minute<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 20 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target:</span> You and up to nine other willing psionic creatures in range<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 1 min./level (D)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 9<br>
      <br>
You link your psychic might with other psionic creatures, creating an entity more powerful than the sum of its parts.<br>
      <br>
When you manifest this power, a number of power points you designate
flows from each participant into a collective pool. One individual is
chosen as the<span style="font-style: italic;"> metaconcert</span>
conductor by mutual consent of the other participants (this is usually
the manifester, but doesn&rsquo;t have to be). Until the power ends,
this conductor directs the efforts of the group. Misty strands of
glowing power link the brows of all the participants in a complex and
shifting pattern.<br>
      <br>
All the powers of each participant are known to the mental entity&nbsp;created with <span style="font-style: italic;">metaconcert</span>
(which is under the conductor&rsquo;s command). This entity can&rsquo;t
take any more actions than a normal individual, but it manifests all
its powers more effectively. Each participant contributing to the
entity provides a cumulative +1 bonus to save DCs that apply when
manifesting a power or using a psi-like ability. Likewise, each
individual provides a cumulative +1 bonus when the entity makes its own
saving throws in response to powers or psi-like abilities.<br>
      <br>
If the psionic entity takes ability damage from a psionic attack the
total is divided among all the members as determined by the conductor.<br>
      <br>
If the entity manifests a power that has an XP cost, all the
participants pay an equal share (the conductor pays the remainder if
the cost can&rsquo;t be divided evenly).<br>
      <br>
Once linked, the participants must remain within a 20-foot-radius area,
and as a group can move at a speed of 10 feet. If a participant moves
outside the 20-foot-radius area occupied by the others (whether
willingly or involuntarily), that individual drops out of the group,
and the power point pool of the <span style="font-style: italic;">metaconcert </span>is instantly recalculated.<br>
      <br>
All participants who leave before a<span style="font-style: italic;"> metaconcert</span>
ends or is dismissed reclaim a number of power points equal to the
current power point pool divided by the number of members. If the
conductor drops out, the power ends. That same number of points is
removed from the power point pool.<br>
      <br>
When a<span style="font-style: italic;"> metaconcert</span> ends
normally or is dismissed, remaining power points in the pool are
divided among all the participants (the conductor receives the
remainder if the points can&rsquo;t be divided evenly).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> For every additional power point you spend, this power&rsquo;s duration increases by 1 minute.<br>
