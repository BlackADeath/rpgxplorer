An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within
this barrier is impervious to most psionic effects, including powers,
psi-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents
the functioning of any psionic items or powers within its confines. A <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field</span>
suppresses any power or psionic effect used within, brought into, or
manifested into its area, but does not negate it. Time spent within a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field </span>counts against a suppressed effect&rsquo;s duration.<br>
      <br>
Astral constructs and summoned creatures wink out if they enter a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field</span>.
They reappear in the same spot once the field goes away. Time spent
winked out counts normally against the duration of the power that is
maintaining the construct or summoned creature.<br>
      <br>
Creation powers with instantaneous durations and calling powers are not affected by a <span style="font-style: italic;">null psio<span style="font-style: italic;">nics</span> field</span> because the power itself is no longer in effect, only its result.<br>
      <br>
A normal creature (a normally encountered construct rather than a
created one, for instance) can enter the area, as can normal missiles.
Furthermore, while a psionic sword does not function psionically within
the area, it is still a sword (and a masterwork sword at that). The
power has no effect on golems and other constructs that are imbued with
magic during their creation process and are thereafter self-supporting
(unless they have been summoned or have a limited duration, in which
case they are treated like any other summoned creatures). Elementals,
corporeal undead, and outsiders are likewise unaffected unless
summoned. These creatures&rsquo; spell-like or supernatural abilities,
however, may be temporarily nullified by the field.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Dispel psionics </span>does not remove the field. Two or more <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics fields</span> sharing any of the same space have no effect on each other. Certain powers may be unaffected by <span style="font-style: italic;">null psionics field</span>
(see the individual power descriptions). Artifacts and deities are
unaffected by mortal power such as this. Should a creature&rsquo;s
space extend across the boundary of the area enclosed by the field, any
part of the creature that lies outside the effect is unaffected by the
field.<br>
