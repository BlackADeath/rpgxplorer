      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Psion/wilder 3<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Visual<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target or Area:</span> One manifester, creature, or object; or 20-ft.-radius burst<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> Instantaneous or 1d4 rounds; see text<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw:</span> None<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Resistance:</span> No<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 5<br>
      <br>
You can use <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span> to
end ongoing powers that have been manifested on a creature or object,
to temporarily suppress the psionic abilities of a psionic item, or to
end ongoing powers (or at least their effects) within an area. A
dispelled power ends as if its duration had expired. Some powers, as
detailed in their descriptions, can&rsquo;t be defeated by dispel
psionics, or can be ended only if you manifest dispel psionics at a
high enough manifester level. Dispel psionics can end spell-like
effects just as it does powers.<br>
      <br>
The effect of a power with an instantaneous duration can&rsquo;t be
dispelled, because the psionic effect is already over before the dispel
psionics can take effect.<br>
      <br>
You choose to use dispel psionics in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or an area dispel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Targeted Dispel:</span> One object, creature, or power is the target of the <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>
power. You make a dispel check (1d20 + your manifester level, maximum
+10) against the power or against each ongoing power currently in
effect on the object or creature. The DC for this dispel check is 11 +
the power&rsquo;s manifester level. If you succeed on a particular
check, that power is dispelled; if you fail, that power remains in
effect.<br>
      <br>
If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing
power or is under the effect of an ongoing power, you make a dispel
check to end the power or its effect. If the object that you target is
a psionic item, you make a dispel check against the item&rsquo;s
manifester level. If you succeed, all the item&rsquo;s psionic
properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers
on its own. A suppressed item becomes nonpsionic for the duration of
the effect. An interdimensional interface&nbsp; is temporarily closed.
A psionic item&rsquo;s physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed
psionic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts
and deities are unaffected by<br>
mortal power such as this.<br>
      <br>
You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any power that you manifested yourself.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Area Dispel: </span>When <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>
is used in this way, the power affects everything within a 20-foot
radius. For each creature within the area that is the subject of one or
more powers, you make a dispel check against the power with the highest
manifester level. If that check fails, you make dispel checks against
progressively weaker powers until you dispel one power (which
discharges the <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span>
power so far as that target is concerned) or until you fail all your
checks. The creature&rsquo;s psionic items are not affected.<br>
For each object within the area that is the target of one or more
powers, you make dispel checks as with creatures. Psionic items are not
affected by an area dispel.<br>
      <br>
For each ongoing area or effect power whose point of origin is within the area of the <span style="font-style: italic;">dispel psionics</span> power, you can make a dispel check to dispel the power.<br>
      <br>
For each ongoing power whose area overlaps that of the dispel <span style="font-style: italic;">psionics power,</span> you can make a dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.<br>
      <br>
If an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing power is in
the area, you can make a dispel check to end the power that created
that object or construct in addition to attempting to dispel powers
targeting the creature or object. You can choose to automatically
succeed on dispel checks against any power that you have manifested.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> For every
additional power point you spend, the bonus on your dispel check
increases by 2 (to a maximum bonus of +20 for a 5-point expenditure).<br>
