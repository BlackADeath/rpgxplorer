You create a finite plane with limited access: a demiplane. Demiplanes
created by this power are very small, very minor planes. This power
works best when manifested while you are on the Astral Plane.
Manifestation of this power creates a local density fluctuation that
precipitates the creation of a demiplane. At first, the fledgling plane
grows in radius at a rate of 1 foot per day to an initial maximum
radius of 180 feet as it rapidly draws substance from the surrounding
astral ectoplasm. Once the new demiplane reaches its maximum size, it
doesn&rsquo;t really stop growing, but its growth rate decreases to
only 1 foot per week (approximately a 50-foot increase in radius per
year). Once your demiplane is created, you can travel to it using <span style="font-style: italic;">astral caravan, plane shift, </span>or some other power or permanent link that you arrange for separately.<br>
      <br>
You determine the environment within the demiplane when you manifest <span style="font-style: italic;">genesis</span>,
reflecting most any desire you can visualize. You determine factors
such as atmosphere, water, temperature, and the general shape of the
terrain. This power cannot create life (including vegetation), nor can
it create construction (such as buildings, roads, wells, dungeons, and
so forth). You must add these details in some other fashion if you
desire. You can&rsquo;t create lingering psionic effects with this
power; you have to add those separately, if desired. Similarly, you
can&rsquo;t create a demiplane out of esoteric material, such as silver
or uranium; you&rsquo;re limited to stone and dirt. You can&rsquo;t
manipulate the time trait on your demiplane; its time trait is as the
Material Plane. Once your demiplane reaches 180 feet in radius, you can
manifest this power again to gradually add another 180 feet of radius
to it, and so on.<br>
      <br>
Antigenesis: If <span style="font-style: italic;">genesis</span> is
manifested on the Material Plane, the power takes effect and the
demiplane begins to grow at the rate noted above, but it gets no larger
than a radius of 1 foot per level. The energies of the new plane are
exactly canceled by the energies of the original plane, creating a dead
spot like a limited cancer on the original plane. The expanding
boundary of the dead spot wipes away all construction, crumbles natural
land forms, and evaporates water, leaving behind a uniformly level area
of inert dust. Living creatures that pass the boundary of the growing
dead spot are not directly affected, but plants can find no sustenance
in the dust of the dead spot, water-breathing creatures die quickly
when water turns to dust, and mobile animals know enough to leave the
area alone. Once the wave of change passes, no special essence remains
in the dead spot, and it may be colonized naturally over the course of
several years by bacteria, plants, and animals.<br>
