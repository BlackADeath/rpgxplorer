      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Psychic warrior 6<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Visual; see text<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> Personal; see text<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target:</span> You<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 1 round/level (D)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 11<br>
      <br>
You wrench from your subconscious a terrifying visage of deadly hunger
and become one with it. You are transformed into a nightmarish version
of yourself, complete with an ooze-sleek skin coating, lashing
tentacles, and a fright-inducing countenance. You effectively gain a
+10 bonus on Disguise checks, though you retain your basic shape and
can continue to use your equipment. This power cannot be used to
impersonate someone; while horrible, your form is recognizably your own.<br>
      <br>
You gain the frightful presence extraordinary ability, which takes
effect automatically when you charge a foe. Opponents within 30 feet of
you that have fewer Hit Dice or levels than you and that witness your
charge become shaken for 5d6 rounds if they fail a Will save (DC 16 +
your Cha modifier). An opponent that succeeds on the saving throw is
immune to your frightful presence for 24 hours. Frightful presence is a
mind-affecting fear effect.<br>
      <br>
Your horrific form grants you a natural armor bonus of +5, damage
reduction 5/&ndash;, and a +4 bonus to your Strength score. In
addition, you gain +10 feet to your land speed as well as a +10 bonus
on Climb and Jump checks.<br>
      <br>
A nest of violently flailing black tentacles sprout from your hair and
back. You can make up to four additional attacks with these tentacles
in addition to your regular melee attacks in each round that you take a
full attack action. You can make tentacle attacks within the space you
normally threaten. If you make your tentacle attacks in addition to you
regular melee attacks, each tentacle attacks at your highest base
attack bonus with a &ndash;5 penalty. If you forgo all your other
attacks, making only tentacle attacks, you make your tentacle attacks
at your highest base attack bonus with no penalty. These tentacles deal
2d8 points of damage plus one-half your Strength bonus on each
successful strike.<br>
      <br>
This power functions only while you inhabit your base form (for
instance, you can&rsquo;t be metamorphed or polymorphed into another
form, though you can use <span style="font-style: italic;">breath of the black dragon</span>,<span style="font-style: italic;"> claws of the beast, </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">bite of the wolf</span> in conjunction with this power for your regular attacks), and while your mind resides within your own body.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> For every additional power point you spend, this power&rsquo;s duration increases by 2 rounds. <br>
