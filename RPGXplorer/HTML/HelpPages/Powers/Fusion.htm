      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Egoist 8<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Auditory, material, and visual<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 round<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> Touch<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Targets:</span> You and one touched willing creature of your type and your size or smaller<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 1 min./level (D)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 15, XP<br>
      <br>
You and another willing, corporeal, living creature of the same or
smaller size fuse into one being. As the manifester, you control the
actions of the fused being. However, you can give up this control to
the other creature. Once you give up control, you cannot regain it
unless the other creature relinquishes it.<br>
      <br>
The fused being has your current hit points plus the other
creature&rsquo;s current hit points. The fused being knows all the
powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of your and the
other creature&rsquo;s power points, and knows or has prepared any
spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise, all
feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled (if both
creatures have the same ability, the fused being gains it only once).
For each of the six ability scores, the fused being&rsquo;s score is
the higher of yours and the other creature&rsquo;s, and the fused being
also has the higher Hit Dice or manifester level&mdash;this effectively
means the fused being uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and
skill modifiers of either member, and it manifests powers at the higher
of the manifester levels that you or the other creature possessed
before becoming fused.<br>
      <br>
You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being and what
equipment remains available for use. These fused items are restored
once the power ends.<br>
      <br>
When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other creature
appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine. If separation
occurs in a cramped space, the other creature is expelled through the
Astral Plane, finally coming to rest materially in the nearest empty
space and taking 1d6 points of damage for each 10 feet of solid
material passed through.<br>
      <br>
Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you and the other creature when the power ends. You do not leave the <span style="font-style: italic;">fusion</span> with more hit points than you entered it with, unless you were damaged prior to the<span style="font-style: italic;"> fusion</span>
and the fused being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the
fused being&rsquo;s remaining power points are split between you and
the other creature (you can leave with more points than you entered
with, as long as you don&rsquo;t exceed the maximum power points for
your level and ability score). Ability damage and negative levels are
also split between you and the other creature. (If an odd number of
negative levels or ability score reductions must be split, you decide
whether you or the other creature receives the additional loss.)<br>
      <br>
If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent creatures, both ofwhich are also dead. You cannot use <span style="font-style: italic;">fission</span> on a fused being.<br>
