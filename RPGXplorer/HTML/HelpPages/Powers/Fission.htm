      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Egoist 7<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Olfactory<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> Personal<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> Duplicate of yourself<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 1 round/level (D)<br>

      <br>
You can divide yourself, creating a duplicate that comes into existence
5 feet away. Your duplicate thinks and acts exactly as you do and
follows your orders, although it will not do anything you
wouldn&rsquo;t do yourself. Your duplicate has all your abilities but
none of your psionic or magical equipment (it does possess a duplicate
of all your mundane equipment, clothing, armor, and implements, as well
as mundane versions of any psionic or magical equipment you have). You
and your duplicate evenly split your power points, your remaining
usages of pertinent special abilities for the day, and so on. You
retain your psionic focus, if you maintain such when this power is
manifested. Treat your duplicate as yourself with two negative levels
for the purpose of determining the powers to which the duplicate has
access (while the duration of this power lasts, those negative levels
cannot be removed by any means). Your duplicate has all other physical
traits you had at the time you manifest this power. Powers, spells, or
other effects affecting you when you manifest this power do not
transfer to your duplicate. <br>
      <br>
When the duration expires or when you dismiss the power, you and your
duplicate rejoin, no matter how far from each other you are. You gain
back any power points the duplicate has not spent. At the time of
rejoining, you take half of the damage your duplicate has taken since
this power was manifested. This damage could potentially leave you with
negative hit points, but it can&rsquo;t reduce your hit points to less
than &ndash;9.<br>
      <br>
If your duplicate dies before the duration expires, no rejoining
occurs, and you gain one negative level. If you die, your duplicate
remains in existence, and is for all intents you, but with two negative
levels. (Once the duration expires, one of the negative levels
immediately converts to one lost level; the other negative level can be
removed by standard means.)<br>
      <br>
You can have only one <span style="font-style: italic;">fissioned</span> duplicate in existence at one time; your duplicate cannot use this power. You cannot use <span style="font-style: italic;">fusion</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">metaconcert </span>with
a duplicate, or share any other power or effect that pools abilities
(the sum of you and you is still just you). Similarly, attempting to
use powers such as <span style="font-style: italic;">claws of the vampire</span> or<span style="font-style: italic;"> vampiric blade</span> to hurt your duplicate only damages your duplicate; these powers do not heal you. <span style="font-style: italic;">Empathic transfer </span>and similar powers are likewise ineffective (transferring wounds to yourself isn&rsquo;t a good healing strategy).<br>
      <br>
All powers affecting a <span style="font-style: italic;">fissioned </span>creature, either the original or the duplicate, end when the <span style="font-style: italic;">fission</span> ends. All damage, including hit point damage, ability damage, ability drain, and ability burn damage, is added together.<br>
