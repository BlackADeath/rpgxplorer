You impress the totality of your psyche into a subject&rsquo;s
subconscious. If successfully implanted, the seed of your mind
&ldquo;germinates&rdquo; over the period of one week. During this time,
the subject begins to unconsciously take on your mannerisms. <br>
      <br>
When integration is complete (after one week), the subject becomes you
in mind as you were when you manifested the power, but the
subject&rsquo;s level is eight lower than your own. (In effect, the
subject has received eight negative levels - but these are negative
levels that can&rsquo;t be removed.) The subject does not have any of
your physical ability scores or equipment, but does have the
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores you had when you were eight
levels lower. The subject also knows the powers you knew when you were
eight levels lower.<br>
      <br>
While the subject is initially your mental duplicate, the two
personalities diverge over time. Although the subject starts off with
memories of your experiences, it possesses its original
&ldquo;soul&rdquo; and physical body and is free to develop its own
personality based on its own new experiences. Thus, the subject is not
your slave or servant, but instead a nonplayer character in its own
right that shares your earlier memories.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Protection from evil</span> or a similar spell or power can prevent you from implanting <span style="font-style: italic;">mind seed</span>,
or prevent a seed from germinating while the protective power lasts.
Otherwise, a germinating seed can be removed (prior to germination)
only by <span style="font-style: italic;">psychic chirurgery, reality revision,</span> or similarly high-level effects. Manifesting <span style="font-style: italic;">mind seed</span> again during the germination period also cleanses the subject&rsquo;s mind.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">XP Cost:</span> 3,000 XP.<br>
