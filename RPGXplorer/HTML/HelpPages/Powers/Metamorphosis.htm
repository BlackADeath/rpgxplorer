      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Egoist 4<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Material and olfactory<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>

      <br>
You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form,
or any other type except construct, elemental, outsider, and undead.
The assumed form can have as many Hit Dice as your manifester level, to
a maximum of 15.<br>
      <br>
You can&rsquo;t assume a form smaller than Fine, nor can you assume an
incorporeal, ectoplasmic, or gaseous form. You cannot take the form of
any creature that has a template. Your type and subtype (if applicable)
change to match the new form.<br>
      <br>
Upon changing, you regain lost hit points as if you had rested for a
night (though this healing does not restore ability damage and provide
other benefits of resting; and changing back does not heal you
further). If you are slain while under the effect of this power, you
revert to your original form, though you remain dead. You gain the
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores of the new form but retain
your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also gain all
extraordinary special attacks possessed by the form (such as constrict,
improved grab, and poison) but do not gain the extraordinary special
qualities possessed by the new form (such as blindsense, fast healing,
regeneration, and scent) or any supernatural, psionic, or spelllike
abilities.<br>
      <br>
You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and special
qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part
that the new form does not have, if any. You keep all extraordinary
special attacks and special qualities derived from class levels, but
you lose any benefits of the racial traits of your normal form. If you
have a template, special abilities it provides are likewise not
retained. If the assumed form is capable of speech, you can communicate
normally. You retain any manifesting ability you had in your original
form.<br>
      <br>
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your
own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement
capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and
flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet
for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as
claws or a bite), racial bonuses on skill checks, racial bonus feats,
and any anatomical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of
extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you
to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than
normal.<br>
      <br>
You can freely designate the new form&rsquo;s minor physical qualities
(such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal
ranges for a creature of that type. The new form&rsquo;s significant
physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under
your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new
form&rsquo;s species. You are effectively disguised as an average
member of the new form&rsquo;s race. If you use this power to create a
disguise, you get a +10 bonus on your Disguise check.<br>
      <br>
When the change occurs, your equipment either remains worn or held by
the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item in
question) or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When
you revert to your normal form, any objects previously melded into the
new form reappear in the same location on your body they previously
occupied and are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the
assumed form and can&rsquo;t wear in your normal form fall off and land
at your feet; any that you could wear in either form or carry in a body
part common to both forms (mouth, hands, or the like) at the time of
reversion are still held in the same way. Any part of the body or piece
of equipment that is separated from the whole reverts to its normal
form.<br>
      <br>
You can also use this power to assume the form of an inanimate object.
You gain the object&rsquo;s hardness and retain your own hit points.
You can take the shape of almost any simple object you can think of. If
you attempt to take the form of a complex object, you must make an
appropriate skill check.. If you fail the check, your manifestation of
the power does not succeed. Likewise, you cannot take the form of a
complex mechanical mechanism unless you have some sort of skill
associated with the object. You cannot use this power to assume the
form of a psionic item or a magic item, or any object with a hardness
of 15 or higher. You also cannot take the form of a psionically
animated mechanism or any object formed of ectoplasm.<br>
      <br>
As an inanimate object, you lose all mobility. You retain your normal
senses and your ability to speak. You can manifest a power if you make
a Concentration check (DC 20 + power level); however, doing so ends the
duration of this power. If you take damage while in the form of an
object, your actual body also takes damage (but the object&rsquo;s
hardness, if any, protects you).<br>
