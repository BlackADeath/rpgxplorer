				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Telepathy (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Psion/wilder 1<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Visual<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 1 standard action<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 20 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span> Cone-shaped emanation centered on you<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> 1 min./level (D)<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw:</span> Will negates<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Resistance:</span> Yes<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 1<br>
      <br>
You broadcast a mental compulsion that convinces one or more creatures
of 4 Hit Dice or less that they are disabled (see page 307 of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Player&rsquo;s Handbook</span>).
Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with
equal Hit Dice, those who are closest to the power&rsquo;s point of
origin are affected first. Hit Dice that are not sufficient to affect a
creature are wasted. Creatures that are rendered helpless or are
destroyed when they reach 0 hit points cannot be affected. <br>
      <br>
Creatures affected by this power believe that they have somehow been
brought to the brink of unconsciousness and must act accordingly. While
it&rsquo;s possible for an important nonplayer character to attempt
some sort of &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; action, common NPCs and creatures
under the effect of this power typically cower or retreat.<br>
      <br>
Any creature that attempts to take a standard action immediately breaks
the compulsion and can act normally. A creature that attempts to heal
itself or that receives healing is likewise freed of the compulsion,
and if it is not actually wounded, the healing is wasted. A creature
that takes damage is also instantly freed of the compulsion (although
the damage still counts against its actual current hit points).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Augment:</span> For every 2 additional power points you spend, this power&rsquo;s range increases by 5 feet and its save DC increases by 1.<br>
      <br>
In addition, for every additional power point you spend to increase the
range and the save DC, this power can affect targets that have Hit Dice
equal to 4 + the number of additional points.<br>
