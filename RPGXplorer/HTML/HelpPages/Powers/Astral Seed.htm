      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level:</span> Shaper 8<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Display:</span> Material; see text<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Manifesting Time:</span> 10 minutes<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range:</span> 0 ft.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span> One storage crystal<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration:</span> Instantaneous<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw:</span> None<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Resistance:</span> No<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Power Points:</span> 15<br>
      <br>
This power weaves strands of astral ectoplasm into a crystal containing
the seed of your living mind (hardness 1 and 1 hit point). You can have
only one <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed</span> in existence at any one time. Until such time as you perish, the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed</span>
(also called the storage crystal) is utterly inert. If you are slain at
some later date, your soul transfers into the storage crystal, which
begins to dimly glow.<br>
      <br>
Upon transference, your physical remains (should they still exist)
become inert matter and cannot thereafter be restored to life. The
transfer from the slain body to the <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed</span> works over any distance, physical or extradimensional.<br>
      <br>
Once your body&rsquo;s physical demise activates the storage crystal,
you have the abilities of a psicrystal of the appropriate level, plus
all the powers you knew and the maximum power points you possessed when
astral seed was manifested - but you also have a negative level that
cannot be healed and that does not convert to real level loss in your
current crystalline form. You have thirty days to grow an organic body,
after which time your sentience fades and your soul passes on if it
hasn&rsquo;t entered a new body.<br>
      <br>
To grow a body, you (in the storage crystal) must spend ten days in
uninterrupted solitude. The body&rsquo;s constituent parts are pulled
as ectoplasm from the Astral Plane, then slowly molded and transformed
into a living, breathing body that is an exact duplicate of your body
at the time you manifested <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed</span>
(the crystal itself breaks down and becomes a part of the new organic
body). When the tenth day ends, you completely and totally inhabit the
new body. You possess all the abilities you possessed when <span style="font-style: italic;">astral seed</span> was manifested, at one level lower, but you have none of your equipment.<br>
      <br>
If the body is struck for any amount of damage during the ten-day
period when it is growing, it is destroyed and your soul passes on.<br>
      <br>
Conceivably, you could manifest <span style="font-style: italic;">mind switch</span>
to utilize a temporary body, but only an evil creature would smash his
own temporarily empty storage crystal to permanently usurp a
subject&rsquo;s organic body (unless the subject is itself irredeemably
evil).<br>
