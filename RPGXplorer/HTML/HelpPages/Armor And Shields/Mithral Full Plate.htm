				<td class="HelpText" valign="top"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Full Plate: </span>The
suit includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a
thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of
full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master
armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner
at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4x100) gold pieces.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Mithral:</span> Mithral is a
very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just
as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from
which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well.
Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes
of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium,
and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still
treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made
from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased
by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).<br>
      <br>
An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item made
from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight does not
change a weapon&rsquo;s size category or the ease with which it can be
wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed). Items not
primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being partially
made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while a scythe
cannot be.)<br>
      <br>
Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well.<br>
      <br>
Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</td>
