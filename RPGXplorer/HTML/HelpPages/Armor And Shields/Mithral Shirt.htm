      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Chain Shirt:</span> A chain shirt comes with a mithral cap.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Mithral: </span>Mithral is a
very rare silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just
as hard. When worked like steel, it becomes a wonderful material from
which to create armor and is occasionally used for other items as well.
Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes
of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium,
and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still
treated as light. Spell failure chances for armors and shields made
from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum Dexterity bonus is increased
by 2, and armor check penalties are lessened by 3 (to a minimum of 0).</p>
      <p>An item made from mithral weighs half as much as the same item
made from other metals. In the case of weapons, this lighter weight
does not change a weapon&rsquo;s size category or the ease with which
it can be wielded (whether it is light, one-handed, or two-handed).
Items not primarily of metal are not meaningfully affected by being
partially made of mithral. (A longsword can be a mithral weapon, while
a scythe cannot be.)</p>
      <p>Weapons or armors fashioned from mithral are always masterwork items as well.</p>
      <p>Mithral has 30 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 15.</p>
