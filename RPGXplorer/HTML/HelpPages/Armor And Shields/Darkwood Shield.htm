      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shield, Heavy, Wooden or Steel:</span>
You strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A heavy
shield is so heavy that you can&rsquo;t use your shield hand for
anything else.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden or Steel: </span>Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shield Bash Attacks: </span>You
can bash an opponent with a heavy shield, using it as an off-hand
weapon. Used
this way, a heavy shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon. For the
purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a heavy shield as a
one-handed weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC
bonus until your next action (usually until the next round). An
enhancement bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a
shield bash made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic
weapon in its own right.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Darkwood: </span>This rare
magic wood is as hard as normal wood but very light. Any wooden or
mostly wooden item (such as a bow, an arrow, or a spear) made from
darkwood is considered a masterwork item and weighs only half as much
as a normal wooden item of that type. Items not normally made of wood
or only partially of wood (such as a battleaxe or a mace) either cannot
be made from darkwood or do not gain any special benefit from being
made of darkwood. The armor check penalty of a darkwood shield is
lessened by 2 compared to an ordinary shield of its type. To determine
the price of a darkwood item, use the original weight but add 10 gp per
pound to the price of a masterwork version of that item.</p>

      
      <p>Darkwood has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and hardness 5.</p>
