      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shield, Light, Wooden or Steel: </span>You
strap a shield to your forearm and grip it with your hand. A light
shield&rsquo;s weight lets you carry other items in that hand, although
you cannot use weapons with it.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Wooden or Steel:</span> Wooden and steel shields offer the same basic protection, though they respond differently to special attacks.</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shield Bash Attacks:</span>
You can bash an opponent with a light shield, using it as an off-hand
weapon. Used this way, a light shield is a martial bludgeoning weapon.
For the purpose of penalties on attack rolls, treat a light shield as a
light weapon. If you use your shield as a weapon, you lose its AC bonus
until your next action (usually until the next round). An enhancement
bonus on a shield does not improve the effectiveness of a shield bash
made with it, but the shield can be made into a magic weapon in its own
right.&nbsp;</p>

      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Armor Spikes:</span> You can have
spikes added to your armor, which allow you to deal extra piercing
damage on a successful grapple attack. The spikes count as a martial
weapon. If you are not proficient with them, you take a &ndash;4 penalty on
grapple checks when you try to use them. You can also make a regular
melee attack (or off-hand attack) with the spikes, and they count as a
light weapon in this case. (You can&rsquo;t also make an attack with armor
spikes if you have already made an attack with another off-hand weapon,
and vice versa.)</p>

      
      <p>An enhancement bonus to a suit of armor does not
improve the spikes&rsquo; effectiveness, but the spikes can be made into
magic weapons in their own right.</p>
