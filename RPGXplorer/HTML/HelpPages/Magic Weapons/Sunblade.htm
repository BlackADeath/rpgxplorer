      <p><strong>Sun Blade:</strong> This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, 
						a sun blade is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and 
						ease of use. (In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard 
						sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if 
						the weapon were a short sword.) Any individual able to use either a bastard 
						sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun 
						blade. Likewise, Weapon Focus and Weapon Specialization in short sword and 
						bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.
					</p>

					
      <p>In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 
						bastard sword. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against 
						Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double 
						damage (and x3 on a critical hit instead of the usual x2).
					</p>

					
      <p>The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing 
						the blade vigorously above her head while speaking a command word. The sunblade 
						then sheds a bright yellow radiance that is like full daylight. The radiance 
						begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward 
						at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 
						60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging, the radiance fades to a dim 
						glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun 
						blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one 
						gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in 
						hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level 
						never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be overcome in any way 
						(including restoration spells) while the sword is wielded.
					</p>

					
      <p>Moderate evocation; CL 10th; Craft Magic Arms and Armor, daylight, creator must 
						be good; Price 50,335 gp; Cost 25,335 gp + 2,000 XP.</p>
