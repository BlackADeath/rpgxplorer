      <p><strong>Power:</strong> The staff of power is a very potent magic item, with 
						offensive and defensive abilities. It is usually topped with a glistening gem, 
						its shaft straight and smooth. It has the following powers:</p>

					
      <ul>

						<li>
							Magic missile (1 charge)</li>

						<li>
							Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
						</li>

						<li>
							Continual flame (1 charge) &bull; Levitate (1 charge)
						</li>

						<li>
							Lightning bolt (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
						</li>

						<li>
							Fireball (heightened to 5th level) (1 charge)
						</li>

						<li>
							Cone of cold (2 charges)
						</li>

						<li>
							Hold monster (2 charges)
						</li>

						<li>
							Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only) (2 
							charges)
						</li>

						<li>
							Globe of invulnerability (2 charges)
						</li>

					
      </ul>

					
      <p>The wielder of a staff of power gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and saving throws. 
						The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite 
						opponents. If 1 charge is expended (as a free action), the staff causes double 
						damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.
					</p>

					
      <p>A staff of power can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken 
						by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by 
						the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the 
						wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are 
						instantly released in a 30-foot radius. All within 2 squares of the broken 
						staff take points of damage equal to 8 x the number of charges in the staff, 
						those 3 or 4 squares away take 6 x the number of charges in damage, and those 5 
						or 6 squares distant take 4 x the number of charges in damage. All those 
						affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.
					</p>

					
      <p>The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane 
						of existence, but if he does not, the explosive release of spell energy 
						destroys him. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff 
						of power, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.
					</p>

					
      <p>After all charges are used up from the staff, it remains a +2 quarterstaff. 
						(Once empty of charges, it cannot be used for a retributive strike.)
					</p>

					
      <p>Strong varied; CL 15th; Craft Staff, Craft Magic Arms and Armor, magic missile, 
						heightened ray of enfeeblement, continual flame, levitate, heightened fireball, 
						heightened lightning bolt, cone of cold, hold monster, wall of force, globe of 
						invulnerability; Price 211,000 gp.</p>
