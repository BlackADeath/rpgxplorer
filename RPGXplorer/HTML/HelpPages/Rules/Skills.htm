  <tbody>



    <tr>



      <td class="HelpText" valign="top">If you buy
a class skill, your character gets 1 rank (equal to a +1 bonus on
checks with that skill) for each skill point. If you buy other classes'
skills (cross-class skills), you get 1/2 rank per skill point.<br>



      <br>



Your maximum rank in a class skill is your character level + 3.<br>



      <br>



Your maximum rank in a cross-class skill is one-half of this number (do
not round up or down).<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Skills:</span>
To make a skill check, roll: 1d20 + skill modifier (Skill modifier =
skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers)<br>



      <br>



This roll works just like an attack roll or a saving throw- the higher
the roll, the better. Either you're trying to match or exceed a certain
Difficulty Class (DC), or you're trying to beat another character's
check result.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill Ranks:</span>
A character's number of ranks in a skill is based on how many skill
points a character has invested in a skill. Many skills can be used
even if the character has no ranks in them; doing this is called making
an untrained skill check.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability Modifier:</span>
The ability modifier used in a skill check is the modifier for the
skill's key ability (the ability associated with the skill's use). The
key ability of each skill is noted in its description.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous
Modifiers:</span> Miscellaneous modifiers include racial bonuses,
armor check penalties, and bonuses provided by feats, among others.<br>



      <br>



Each skill point you spend on a class skill gets you 1 rank in that
skill. Class skills are the skills found on your character's class
skill list. Each skill point you spend on a cross-class skill gets your
character 1/2 rank in that skill. Cross-class skills are skills not
found on your character's class skill list. (Half ranks do not improve
your skill check, but two 1/2 ranks make 1 rank.) You can't save skill
points to spend later.<br>



      <br>



The maximum rank in a class skill is the character's level + 3. If it's
a cross-class skill, the maximum rank is half of that number (do not
round up or down).<br>



      <br>



Regardless of whether a skill is purchased as a class skill or a
cross-class skill, if it is a class skill for any of your classes, your
maximum rank equals your total character level + 3.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using Skills: </span>When
your character uses a skill, you make a skill check to see how well he
or she does. The higher the result of the skill check, the better.
Based on the circumstances, your result must match or beat a particular
number (a DC or the result of an opposed skill check) for the check to
be successful. The harder the task, the higher the number you need to
roll.<br>



      <br>



Circumstances can affect your check. A character who is free to work
without distractions can make a careful attempt and avoid simple
mistakes. A character who has lots of time can try over and over again,
thereby assuring the best outcome. If others help, the character may
succeed where otherwise he or she would fail.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill Checks: </span>A
skill check takes into account a character's training (skill rank),
natural talent (ability modifier), and luck (the die roll). It may also
take into account his or her race's knack for doing certain things
(racial bonus) or what armor he or she is wearing (armor check
penalty), or a certain feat the character possesses, among other things.<br>



      <br>



To make a skill check, roll 1d20 and add your character's skill
modifier for that skill. The skill modifier incorporates the
character's ranks in that skill and the ability modifier for that
skill's key ability, plus any other miscellaneous modifiers that may
apply, including racial bonuses and armor check penalties. The higher
the result, the better. Unlike with attack rolls and saving throws, a
natural roll of 20 on the d20 is not an automatic success, and a
natural roll of 1 is not an automatic failure.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Difficulty Class: </span>Some
checks are made against a Difficulty Class (DC). The DC is a number
(set using the skill rules as a guideline) that you must score as a
result on your skill check in order to succeed.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opposed Checks:</span>
An opposed check is a check whose success or failure is determined by
comparing the check result to another character's check result. In an
opposed check, the higher result succeeds, while the lower result
fails. In case of a tie, the higher skill modifier wins. If these
scores are the same, roll again to break the tie.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Trying Again: </span>In
general, you can try a skill check again if you fail, and you can keep
trying indefinitely. Some skills, however, have consequences of failure
that must be taken into account. A few skills are virtually useless
once a check has failed on an attempt to accomplish a particular task.
For most skills, when a character has succeeded once at a given task,
additional successes are meaningless.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Untrained Skill
Checks: </span>Generally, if your character attempts to use a
skill he or she does not possess, you make a skill check as normal. The
skill modifier doesn't have a skill rank added in because the character
has no ranks in the skill. Any other applicable modifiers, such as the
modifier for the skill's key ability, are applied to the check.<br>



      <br>



Many skills can be used only by someone who is trained in them.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Favorable and
Unfavorable Conditions: </span>Some situations may make a skill
easier or harder to use, resulting in a bonus or penalty to the skill
modifier for a skill check or a change to the DC of the skill check.<br>



      <br>



The chance of success can be altered in four ways to take into account
exceptional circumstances.<br>



      
      
      <ol>



        <li>Give the skill user a +2 circumstance bonus to
represent conditions that improve performance, such as having the
perfect tool for the job, getting help from another character (see
Combining Skill Attempts), or possessing unusually accurate information.</li>



        <li>Give the skill user a -2 circumstance penalty to
represent conditions that hamper performance, such as being forced to
use improvised tools or having misleading information.</li>



        <li>Reduce the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that
make the task easier, such as having a friendly audience or doing work
that can be subpar.</li>



        <li>Increase the DC by 2 to represent circumstances that
make the task harder, such as having an uncooperative audience or doing
work that must be flawless.</li>



      
      
      </ol>



Conditions that affect your character's ability to perform the skill
change the skill modifier. Conditions that modify how well the
character has to perform the skill to succeed change the DC. A bonus to
the skill modifier and a reduction in the check's DC have the same
result: They create a better chance of success. But they represent
different circumstances, and sometimes that difference is important.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Time and Skill
Checks: </span>Using a skill might take a round, take no time,
or take several rounds or even longer. Most skill uses are standard
actions, move actions, or full-round actions. Types of actions define
how long activities take to perform within the framework of a combat
round (6 seconds) and how movement is treated with respect to the
activity. Some skill checks are instant and represent reactions to an
event, or are included as part of an action.<br>



      <br>



These skill checks are not actions. Other skill checks represent part
of movement.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Checks without
Rolls: </span>A skill check represents an attempt to accomplish
some goal, usually while under some sort of time pressure or
distraction. Sometimes, though, a character can use a skill under more
favorable conditions and eliminate the luck factor.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking 10:</span>
When your character is not being threatened or distracted, you may
choose to take 10. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check,
calculate your result as if you had rolled a 10. For many routine
tasks, taking 10 makes them automatically successful. Distractions or
threats (such as combat) make it impossible for a character to take 10.
In most cases, taking 10 is purely a safety measure -you know (or
expect) that an average roll will succeed but fear that a poor roll
might fail, so you elect to settle for the average roll (a 10). Taking
10 is especially useful in situations where a particularly high roll
wouldn't help.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Taking 20: </span>When
you have plenty of time (generally 2 minutes for a skill that can
normally be checked in 1 round, one full-round action, or one standard
action), you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill
being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In
other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough
times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your
result as if you had rolled a 20.<br>



      <br>



Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes
that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty
times as long as making a single check would take.<br>



      <br>



Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before
succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries
penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those
penalties before he or she could complete the task. Common "take 20"
skills include Escape Artist, Open Lock, and Search.<br>



      <br>



Ability Checks and Caster Level Checks: The normal take 10 and take 20
rules apply for ability checks. Neither rule applies to caster level
checks.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Combining Skill
Attempts: </span>When more than one character tries the same
skill at the same time and for the same purpose, their efforts may
overlap.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Individual Events: </span>Often,
several characters attempt some action and each succeeds or fails
independently.&nbsp; The result of one character's Climb check does
not influence the results of other characters Climb check.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aid Another: </span>You
can help another character achieve success on his or her skill check by
making the same kind of skill check in a cooperative effort. If you
roll a 10 or higher on your check, the character you are helping gets a
+2 bonus to his or her check, as per the rule for favorable conditions.
(You can't take 10 on a skill check to aid another.) In many cases, a
character's help won't be beneficial, or only a limited number of
characters can help at once.<br>



      <br>



In cases where the skill restricts who can achieve certain results you
can't aid another to grant a bonus to a task that your character
couldn't achieve alone.<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skill Synergy: </span>It's
possible for a character to have two skills that work well together. In
general, having 5 or more ranks in one skill gives the character a +2
bonus on skill checks with each of its synergistic skills, as noted in
the skill description. In some cases, this bonus applies only to
specific uses of the skill in question, and not to all checks. Some
skills provide benefits on other checks made by a character, such as
those checks required to use certain class features. &nbsp;<br>



      <br>



      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ability
Checks: </span>Sometimes a character tries to do something to
which no specific skill really applies. In these cases, you make an
ability check. An ability check is a roll of 1d20 plus the appropriate
ability modifier. Essentially, you're making an untrained skill check.<br>



      <br>



In some cases, an action is a straight test of one's ability with no
luck involved. Just as you wouldn't make a height check to see who is
taller, you don't make a Strength check to see who is stronger.</td>
