					<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Magic weapons have enhancement
bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack
and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also
masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonus on attack rolls does not
stack with their enhancement bonus on attack rolls.<br>


      <br>


Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the
weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In
this case, their enhancement bonus applies to either type of attack.<br>
      <br>


In addition to an enhancement bonus, weapons may have special
abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for
determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or
damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon
cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability
bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability
must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Caster Level for Weapons: </span>The
caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item
description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other
abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an
item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of
the two caster level requirements must be met.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Damage Dice:</span>
Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other
modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when
the attacker scores a critical hit.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ranged Weapons and Ammunition:</span>
The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the
enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two
enhancement bonuses applies.<br>


      <br>


Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of
+1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon
with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in
addition to any alignment it may already have).<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Ammunition and Breakage: </span>When
a magic arrow, crossbow bolt, or sling bullet misses its target, there
is a 50% chance it breaks or otherwise is rendered useless. A magic
arrow, bolt, or bullet that hits is destroyed.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Light Generation:</span> Fully
30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell (bright
light in a 20-foot radius, shadowy light in a 40-foot radius). These
glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. Such a weapon can&rsquo;t
be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Some of the
specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in
their descriptions.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hardness and Hit Points:</span>
An attacker cannot damage a magic weapon that has an enhancement bonus
unless his own weapon has at least as high an enhancement bonus as the
weapon or shield struck. Each +1 of enhancement bonus also adds 1 to
the weapon&rsquo;s or shield&rsquo;s hardness and hit points.<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation:</span> Usually a
character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character
benefits from a mundane weapon&mdash;by attacking with it. If a weapon
has a special ability that the user needs to activate then the user
usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action).<br>


      <br>


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Magic Weapons and Critical Hits:</span>
Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on
a critical hit. This special effect functions against creatures not
subject to critical hits, such as undead, elementals, and constructs.
When fighting against such creatures, roll for critical hits as you
would against humanoids or any other creature subject to critical hits.
On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not
multiply the weapon&rsquo;s regular damage.<br>

      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures: </span>The
cost of weapons for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium varies.
The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains
the same. </td>
