					<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons:</span>
Anybody but a druid, monk, rogue, or wizard is proficient with all
simple weapons. Barbarians, fighters, paladins, and rangers are
proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other
classes are proficient with an assortment of mainly simple weapons and
possibly also some martial or even exotic weapons. A character who uses
a weapon with which he or she is not proficient takes a -4 penalty on
attack rolls.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Melee and Ranged Weapons:</span>&nbsp;
Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some of them
can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons are thrown weapons or projectile
weapons that are not effective in melee.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Reach Weapons: </span>Glaives,
guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, spiked chains, and whips are
reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder
to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him or her. Most reach
double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or
Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but
not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character
wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature
15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10
feet away.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Double Weapons:</span> Dire
flails, dwarven urgroshes, gnome hooked hammers, orc double axes,
quarterstaffs, and two-bladed swords are double weapons. A character
can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two
weapons, but he or she incurs all the normal attack penalties
associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were
wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.<br>
      <br>
The character can also choose to use a double weapon two handed,
attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon
in one hand can't use it as a double weapon-only one end of the weapon
can be used in any given round.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Thrown Weapons:</span> Daggers,
clubs, shortspears, spears, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light
hammers, tridents, shuriken, and nets are thrown weapons. The wielder
applies his or her Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons
(except for splash weapons). It is possible to throw a weapon that
isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have
a numeric entry in the Range Increment column on Table: Weapons), but a
character who does so takes a -4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a
light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a
two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of
weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and
deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range
increment of 10 feet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Projectile Weapons:</span>
Light crossbows, slings, heavy crossbows, shortbows, composite
shortbows, longbows, composite longbows, hand crossbows, and repeating
crossbows are projectile weapons. Most projectile weapons require two
hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character gets no
Strength bonus on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a
specially built composite shortbow, specially built composite longbow,
or sling. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to
damage rolls when he or she uses a bow or a sling.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Ammunition:</span> Projectile
weapons use ammunition: arrows (for bows), bolts (for crossbows), or
sling bullets (for slings). When using a bow, a character can draw
ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for
reloading. Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is
destroyed or rendered useless, while normal ammunition that misses has
a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.<br>
      <br>
Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition
for the purposes of drawing them, crafting masterwork or otherwise
special versions of them (see Masterwork Weapons), and what happens to
them after they are thrown.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons:</span>&nbsp;
This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a
weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by
a character of the weapon's size category, is considered a light
weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Light:</span> A light weapon is
easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and it can
be used while grappling. A light weapon is used in one hand. Add the
wielder's Strength bonus (if any) to damage rolls for melee attacks
with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or one-half the
wielder's Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. Using two hands
to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength
bonus applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary
hand only.<br>
      <br>
An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">One-Handed:</span> A one-handed
weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the
wielder's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks with a
one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or 1/2 his or her
Strength bonus if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is
wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the
character's Strength bonus to damage rolls.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Two-Handed:</span> Two hands
are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2
times the character's Strength bonus to damage rolls for melee attacks
with such a weapon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weapon Size:</span> Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed.<br>
      <br>
A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object.
Instead, a weapon's size category is keyed to the size of the intended
wielder. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories
smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size
category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object
of the same size category as the wielder.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Inappropriately Sized Weapons:</span>
A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized
for it. A cumulative -2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size
category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the
size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the
weapon a -4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.<br>
      <br>
The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the
weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a
particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of
difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for
which the weapon was designed. If a weapon's designation would be
changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by
this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Improvised Weapons:</span>
Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in
combat. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any
creature that uses one in combat is considered to be nonproficient with
it and takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To
determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised
weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon
list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a threat
on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An
improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.<br>

      
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cost: </span>This
value is the weapon's cost in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp).
The cost includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon.<br>
      <br>
This cost is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Damage:</span> The Damage
columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit
according to the size of the weapon. If two damage ranges are given
then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given
for the double weapon's extra attack. <br>

of 19-20.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">18-20/x2:</span> The weapon
scores a threat on a natural roll of 18, 19, or 20 (instead of just 20)
and deals double damage on a critical hit. (The weapon has a threat
range of 18-20.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range Increment:</span> Any
attack at less than this distance is not penalized for range. However,
each full range increment imposes a cumulative -2 penalty on the attack
roll. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A
projectile weapon can shoot out to ten range increments.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Weight:</span> This column gives
the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for
Small weapons and double it for Large weapons.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Type:</span> Weapons are
classified according to the type of damage they deal: bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to
attacks from certain types of weapons.<br>
      <br>
Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon is of two
types, the damage it deals is not half one type and half another; all
of it is both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to
both types of damage to ignore any of the damage from such a weapon.<br>
      <br>
In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a
situation when the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose
which type of damage to deal with such a weapon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Special:</span> Some weapons have special features. See the weapon descriptions for details. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Masterwork Weapons: </span>A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.<br>
      <br>
You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created;
it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill). The
masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp
to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork
quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).<br>
      <br>
Masterwork ammunition is damaged (effectively destroyed) when used. The
enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any
enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.<br>
      <br>
All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork
quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality
doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.<br>
      <br>
Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you
can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an
enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and
shields have lessened armor check penalties.<br>
