				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">A scroll is a spell (or
collection of spells) that has been stored in written form. A spell on
a scroll can be used only once. The writing vanishes from the scroll
when the spell is activated. Using a scroll is basically like casting a
spell.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scribe Scroll:</span> You can
create a scroll of any spell that you know (you must therefore have
Caster Level of at least 1). Scribing a scroll takes one day for each
1,000 gp in its base price. The base price of a scroll is its spell
level x its caster level x 25 gp. To scribe a scroll, you must spend
1/25 of this base price in XP and use up raw materials costing one-half
of this base price.<br>
      <br>
Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or an
XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs
derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or
pay the XP when scribing the scroll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Description: </span>A
scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area
about 8 1/2 inches wide and 11 inches long is sufficient to hold one
spell. The sheet is reinforced at the top and bottom with strips of
leather slightly longer than the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more
than one spell has the same width (about 8 1/2 inches) but is an extra
foot or so long for each extra spell. Scrolls that hold three or more
spells are usually fitted with reinforcing rods at each end rather than
simple strips of leather. A scroll has AC 9, 1 hit point, hardness 0,
and a break DC of 8.<br>
      <br>
To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from
both ends to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll
the scroll quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade,
leather, metal, or wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic
symbols which often identify the owner or the spells stored on the
scrolls inside. The symbols often hide magic traps.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activation: </span>To activate a scroll, a spellcaster must read the spell written on it. Doing so involves several steps and conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Decipher the Writing: </span>The
writing on a scroll must be deciphered before a character can use it or
know exactly what spell it contains. This requires a read magic spell
or a successful Spellcraft check (DC 20 + spell level).<br>
      <br>
Deciphering a scroll to determine its contents does not activate its
magic unless it is a specially prepared cursed scroll. A character can
decipher the writing on a scroll in advance so that he or she can
proceed directly to the next step when the time comes to use the scroll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Activate the Spell: </span>Activating
a scroll requires reading the spell from the scroll. The character must
be able to see and read the writing on the scroll. Activating a scroll
spell requires no material components or focus. (The creator of the
scroll provided these when scribing the scroll.) Note that some spells
are effective only when cast on an item or items. In such a case, the
scroll user must provide the item when activating the spell. Activating
a scroll spell is subject to disruption just as casting a normally
prepared spell would be. Using a scroll is like casting a spell for
purposes of arcane spell failure chance.<br>
      <br>
To have any chance of activating a scroll spell, the scroll user must meet the following requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The spell must be of the correct type (arcane or divine).
Arcane spellcasters (wizards, sorcerers, and bards) can only use
scrolls containing arcane spells, and divine spellcasters (clerics,
druids, paladins, and rangers) can only use scrolls containing divine
spells. (The type of scroll a character creates is also determined by
his or her class.)</li>
        <li>The user must have the spell on his or her class list.</li>
        <li>The user must have the requisite ability score.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
If the user meets all the requirements noted above, and her caster
level is at least equal to the spell's caster level, she can
automatically activate the spell without a check. If she meets all
three requirements but her own caster level is lower than the scroll
spell's caster level, then she has to make a caster level check (DC =
scroll's caster level + 1) to cast the spell successfully. If she
fails, she must make a DC 5 Wisdom check to avoid a mishap (see Scroll
Mishaps, below). A natural roll of 1 always fails, whatever the
modifiers.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Determine Effect:</span> A spell
successfully activated from a scroll works exactly like a spell
prepared and cast the normal way. Assume the scroll spell's caster
level is always the minimum level required to cast the spell for the
character who scribed the scroll (usually twice the spell's level,
minus 1), unless the caster specifically desires otherwise.<br>
      <br>
The writing for an activated spell disappears from the scroll.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Scroll Mishaps:</span> When a mishap occurs, the spell on the scroll has a reversed or harmful effect. Possible mishaps are given below.<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>A surge of uncontrolled magical energy deals 1d6 points of damage per spell level to the scroll user.</li>
        <li>Spell strikes the scroll user or an ally instead of the
intended target, or a random target nearby if the scroll user was the
intended recipient.</li>
        <li>Spell takes effect at some random location within spell range.</li>
        <li>Spell's effect on the target is contrary to the spell's normal effect.</li>
        <li>The scroll user suffers some minor but bizarre effect
related to the spell in some way. Most such effects should last only as
long as the original spell's duration, or 2d10 minutes for
instantaneous spells.</li>
        <li>Some innocuous item or items appear in the spell's area.</li>
        <li>Spell has delayed effect. Sometime within the next 1d12
hours, the spell activates. If the scroll user was the intended
recipient, the spell takes effect normally. If the user was not the
intended recipient, the spell goes off in the general direction of the
original recipient or target, up to the spell's maximum range, if the
target has moved away.</li>
      </ul>
