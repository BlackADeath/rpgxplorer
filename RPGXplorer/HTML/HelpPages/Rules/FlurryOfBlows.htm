						<P class="MsoNormal"><SPAN style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Flurry of Blows (Ex):</SPAN> When 
							unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. 
							When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base 
							attack bonus, but this attack takes a –2 penalty, as does each other attack 
							made that round.&nbsp;This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects 
							attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk 
							reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to –1, and at 9th level it disappears. A 
							monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.</P>
						<P class="MsoNormal">When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with 
							unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, 
							sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special 
							monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry 
							of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x&nbsp; 1-1/2 or x 
							1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a 
							weapon in one or both hands. The monk can’t use any weapon other than a special 
							monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.</P>
						<P class="MsoNormal">In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate 
							weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the 
							quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed 
							strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her 
							flurry of blows routine to do so.&nbsp;</P>
						<P class="MsoNormal">When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability 
							improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry 
							of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.</P>
