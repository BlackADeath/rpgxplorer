      <p>In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical 
						armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and 
						stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement 
						bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check 
						penalties by 1.
					</p>

					
      <p>In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special 
						abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value 
						of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective 
						bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A 
						suit of armor with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
					</p>

					
      <p>Armor is always created so that even if the type of armor comes with boots or 
						gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots or gauntlets.
					</p>

					
      <p><strong>Caster Level for Armor and Shields:</strong> The caster level of a magic 
						shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. 
						For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the 
						enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special 
						ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.
					</p>

					
      <p><strong>Shields:</strong> Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor 
						enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage 
						bonuses when the shield is used in a bash. The bashing special ability, 
						however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special 
						ability description). A shield could be built that also acted as a magic 
						weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be 
						added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.
					</p>

					
      <p>As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value 
						in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not 
						improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special 
						ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability 
						must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.
					</p>

					
      <p><strong>Shield Hardness and Hit Points: </strong>Each +1 of enhancement bonus 
						adds 2 to a shield's hardness and +10 to its hit points.
					</p>

					
      <p><strong>Activation:</strong> Usually a character benefits from magic armor and 
						shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and 
						shields-by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the 
						user needs to activate then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a 
						standard action).
					</p>

					
      <p><strong>Armor for Unusual Creatures: </strong>The cost of armor for nonhumanoid 
						creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. 
						The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the 
						same.
