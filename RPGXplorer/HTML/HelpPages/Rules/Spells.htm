    <tr>



				<td class="HelpText" valign="top"><span style="font-weight: bold;">School (Subschool): </span>Beneath the spell name is a line giving the school of magic (and the subschool, if appropriate) that the spell belongs to.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[Descriptor]:</span> Appearing
on the same line as the school and subschool, when applicable, is a
descriptor that further categorizes the spell in some way. Some spells
have more than one descriptor.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Level: </span>The next line of a
spell description gives the spell&rsquo;s level, a number between 0 and
9 that defines the spell&rsquo;s relative power. This number is
preceded by an abbreviation for the class whose members can cast the
spell. The Level entry also indicates whether a spell is a domain spell
and, if so, what its domain and its level as a domain spell are. A
spell&rsquo;s level affects the DC for any save allowed against the
effect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Components: </span>A
spell&rsquo;s components are what you must do or possess to cast it.
The Components entry in a spell description includes abbreviations that
tell you what type of components it has. Specifics for material, focus,
and XP components are given at the end of the descriptive text. Usually
you don&rsquo;t worry about components, but when you can&rsquo;t use a
component for some reason or when a material or focus component is
expensive, then the components are important.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Verbal (V):</span> A verbal
component is a spoken incantation. To provide a verbal component, you
must be able to speak in a strong voice. A silence spell or a gag
spoils the incantation (and thus the spell). A spellcaster who has been
deafened has a 20% chance to spoil any spell with a verbal component
that he or she tries to cast.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Somatic (S):</span> A somatic
component is a measured and precise movement of the hand. You must have
at least one hand free to provide a somatic component.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Material (M):</span> A material
component is one or more physical substances or objects that are
annihilated by the spell energies in the casting process. Unless a cost
is given for a material component, the cost is negligible. Don&rsquo;t
bother to keep track of material components with negligible cost.
Assume you have all you need as long as you have your spell component
pouch.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Focus (F):</span> A focus
component is a prop of some sort. Unlike a material component, a focus
is not consumed when the spell is cast and can be reused. As with
material components, the cost for a focus is negligible unless a price
is given. Assume that focus components of negligible cost are in your
spell component pouch.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Divine Focus (DF):</span> A
divine focus component is an item of spiritual significance. The divine
focus for a cleric or a paladin is a holy symbol appropriate to the
character&rsquo;s faith. <br>
      <br>
If the Components line includes F/DF or M/DF, the arcane version of the
spell has a focus component or a material component (the abbreviation
before the slash) and the divine version has a divine focus component
(the abbreviation after the slash).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">XP Cost (XP):</span> Some
powerful spells entail an experience point cost to you. No spell can
restore the XP lost in this manner. You cannot spend so much XP that
you lose a level, so you cannot cast the spell unless you have enough
XP to spare. However, you may, on gaining enough XP to attain a new
level, use those XP for casting a spell rather than keeping them and
advancing a level. The XP are treated just like a material component -
expended when you cast the spell, whether or not the casting succeeds.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Casting Time: </span>Most spells have a casting time of 1 standard action. Others take 1 round or more, while a few require only a free action.<br>
      <br>
A spell that takes 1 round to cast is a full-round action. It comes
into effect just before the beginning of your turn in the round after
you began casting the spell. You then act normally after the spell is
completed.<br>
      <br>
A spell that takes 1 minute to cast comes into effect just before your
turn 1 minute later (and for each of those 10 rounds, you are casting a
spell as a full-round action, just as noted above for 1- round casting
times). These actions must be consecutive and uninterrupted, or the
spell automatically fails.<br>
      <br>
When you begin a spell that takes 1 round or longer to cast, you must
continue the concentration from the current round to just before your
turn in the next round (at least). If you lose concentration before the
casting is complete, you lose the spell.<br>
      <br>
A spell with a casting time of 1 free action doesn&rsquo;t count
against your normal limit of one spell per round. However, you may cast
such a spell only once per round. Casting a spell with a casting time
of 1 free action doesn&rsquo;t provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
You make all pertinent decisions about a spell (range, target, area,
effect, version, and so forth) when the spell comes into effect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Range: </span>A spell&rsquo;s
range indicates how far from you it can reach, as defined in the Range
entry of the spell description. A spell&rsquo;s range is the maximum
distance from you that the spell&rsquo;s effect can occur, as well as
the maximum distance at which you can designate the spell&rsquo;s point
of origin. If any portion of the spell&rsquo;s area would extend beyond
this range, that area is wasted. Standard ranges include the following:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Personal:</span> The spell affects only you.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Touch: </span>You must touch a
creature or object to affect it. A touch spell that deals damage can
score a critical hit just as a weapon can. A touch spell threatens a
critical hit on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a
successful critical hit. Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple
targets. You can touch as many willing targets as you can reach as part
of the casting, but all targets of the spell must be touched in the
same round that you finish casting the spell.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Close:</span> The spell reaches as far as 25 feet away from you. The maximum range increases by 5 feet for every two full caster levels.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Medium:</span> The spell reaches as far as 100 feet + 10 feet per caster level.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Long:</span> The spell reaches as far as 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Unlimited:</span> The spell reaches anywhere on the same plane of existence.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Range Expressed in Feet:</span> Some spells have no standard range category, just a range expressed in feet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Aiming a Spell: </span>You must
make some choice about whom the spell is to affect or where the effect
is to originate, depending on the type of spell. The next entry in a
spell description defines the spell&rsquo;s target (or targets), its
effect, or its area, as appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Target or Targets:</span> Some
spells have a target or targets. You cast these spells on creatures or
objects, as defined by the spell itself. You must be able to see or
touch the target, and you must specifically choose that target. You do
not have to select your target until you finish casting the spell.<br>
      <br>
If the target of a spell is yourself (the spell description has a line
that reads Target: You), you do not receive a saving throw, and spell
resistance does not apply. The Saving Throw and Spell Resistance lines
are omitted from such spells.<br>
      <br>
Some spells restrict you to willing targets only. Declaring yourself as
a willing target is something that can be done at any time (even if
you&rsquo;re flat-footed or it isn&rsquo;t your turn). Unconscious
creatures are automatically considered willing, but a character who is
conscious but immobile or helpless (such as one who is bound, cowering,
grappling, paralyzed, pinned, or stunned) is not automatically willing.<br>
      <br>
Some spells allow you to redirect the effect to new targets or areas
after you cast the spell. Redirecting a spell is a move action that
does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Some spells create or summon things rather than affecting things that are already present.<br>
      <br>
You must designate the location where these things are to appear,
either by seeing it or defining it. Range determines how far away an
effect can appear, but if the effect is mobile it can move regardless
of the spell&rsquo;s range.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Ray:</span> Some effects are
rays. You aim a ray as if using a ranged weapon, though typically you
make a ranged touch attack rather than a normal ranged attack. As with
a ranged weapon, you can fire into the dark or at an invisible creature
and hope you hit something. You don&rsquo;t have to see the creature
you&rsquo;re trying to hit, as you do with a targeted spell.
Intervening creatures and obstacles, however, can block your line of
sight or provide cover for the creature you&rsquo;re aiming at.<br>
      <br>
If a ray spell has a duration, it&rsquo;s the duration of the effect
that the ray causes, not the length of time the ray itself persists.<br>
      <br>
If a ray spell deals damage, you can score a critical hit just as if it
were a weapon. A ray spell threatens a critical hit on a natural roll
of 20 and deals double damage on a successful critical hit.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Spread:</span> Some effects,
notably clouds and fogs, spread out from a point of origin, which must
be a grid intersection. The effect can extend around corners and into
areas that you can&rsquo;t see. Figure distance by actual distance
traveled, taking into account turns the spell effect takes. When
determining distance for spread effects, count around walls, not
through them. As with movement, do not trace diagonals across corners.
You must designate the point of origin for such an effect, but you need
not have line of effect (see below) to all portions of the effect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Area:</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Some
spells affect an area. Sometimes a spell description specifies a
specially defined area, but usually an area falls into one of the
categories defined below.<br>
      <br>
Regardless of the shape of the area, you select the point where the
spell originates, but otherwise you don&rsquo;t control which creatures
or objects the spell affects. The point of origin of a spell is always
a grid intersection. When determining whether a given creature is
within the area of a spell, count out the distance from the point of
origin in squares just as you do when moving a character or when
determining the range for a ranged attack. The only difference is that
instead of counting from the center of one square to the center of the
next, you count from intersection to intersection.<br>
      <br>
You can count diagonally across a square, but remember that every
second diagonal counts as 2 squares of distance. If the far edge of a
square is within the spell&rsquo;s area, anything within that square is
within the spell&rsquo;s area. If the spell&rsquo;s area only touches
the near edge of a square, however, anything within that square is
unaffected by the spell.<br>
      <br>
Burst, Emanation, or Spread: Most spells that affect an area function
as a burst, an emanation, or a spread. In each case, you select the
spell&rsquo;s point of origin and measure its effect from that point.<br>
      <br>
A burst spell affects whatever it catches in its area, even including
creatures that you can&rsquo;t see. It can&rsquo;t affect creatures
with total cover from its point of origin (in other words, its effects
don&rsquo;t extend around corners). The default shape for a burst
effect is a sphere, but some burst spells are specifically described as
cone-shaped. A burst&rsquo;s area defines how far from the point of
origin the spell&rsquo;s effect extends.<br>
      <br>
An emanation spell functions like a burst spell, except that the effect
continues to radiate from the point of origin for the duration of the
spell. Most emanations are cones or spheres.<br>
      <br>
A spread spell spreads out like a burst but can turn corners. You
select the point of origin, and the spell spreads out a given distance
in all directions. Figure the area the spell effect fills by taking
into account any turns the spell effect takes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Cone, Cylinder, Line, or Sphere:</span> Most spells that affect an area have a particular shape, such as a cone, cylinder, line, or sphere.<br>
      <br>
A cone-shaped spell shoots away from you in a quarter-circle in the
direction you designate. It starts from any corner of your square and
widens out as it goes. Most cones are either bursts or emanations (see
above), and thus won&rsquo;t go around corners.<br>
      <br>
When casting a cylinder-shaped spell, you select the spell&rsquo;s
point of origin. This point is the center of a horizontal circle, and
the spell shoots down from the circle, filling a cylinder. A
cylinder-shaped spell ignores any obstructions within its area.<br>
      <br>
A line-shaped spell shoots away from you in a line in the direction you
designate. It starts from any corner of your square and extends to the
limit of its range or until it strikes a barrier that blocks line of
effect. A line-shaped spell affects all creatures in squares that the
line passes through.<br>
      <br>
A sphere-shaped spell expands from its point of origin to fill a spherical area. Spheres may be bursts, emanations, or spreads.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Creatures:</span> A spell with
this kind of area affects creatures directly (like a targeted spell),
but it affects all creatures in an area of some kind rather than
individual creatures you select. The area might be a spherical burst ,
a cone-shaped burst, or some other shape.<br>
      <br>
Many spells affect &ldquo;living creatures,&rdquo; which means all
creatures other than constructs and undead. Creatures in the
spell&rsquo;s area that are not of the appropriate type do not count
against the creatures affected.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Objects:</span> A spell with this kind of area affects objects within an area you select (as Creatures, but affecting objects instead).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Other:</span> A spell can have a unique area, as defined in its description.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">(S) Shapeable:</span> If an
Area or Effect entry ends with &ldquo;(S),&rdquo; you can shape the
spell. A shaped effect or area can have no dimension smaller than 10
feet. Many effects or areas are given as cubes to make it easy to model
irregular shapes. Three-dimensional volumes are most often needed to
define aerial or underwater effects and areas.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Line of Effect:</span> A line of
effect is a straight, unblocked path that indicates what a spell can
affect. A line of effect is canceled by a solid barrier. It&rsquo;s
like line of sight for ranged weapons, except that it&rsquo;s not
blocked by fog, darkness, and other factors that limit normal sight.<br>
      <br>
You must have a clear line of effect to any target that you cast a
spell on or to any space in which you wish to create an effect. You
must have a clear line of effect to the point of origin of any spell
you cast.<br>
      <br>
A burst, cone, cylinder, or emanation spell affects only an area,
creatures, or objects to which it has line of effect from its origin (a
spherical burst&rsquo;s center point, a cone-shaped burst&rsquo;s
starting point, a cylinder&rsquo;s circle, or an emanation&rsquo;s
point of origin).<br>
      <br>
An otherwise solid barrier with a hole of at least 1 square foot
through it does not block a spell&rsquo;s line of effect. Such an
opening means that the 5-foot length of wall containing the hole is no
longer considered a barrier for purposes of a spell&rsquo;s line of
effect.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Duration: </span>A spell&rsquo;s Duration entry tells you how long the magical energy of the spell lasts.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Timed Durations:</span> Many
durations are measured in rounds, minutes, hours, or some other
increment. When the time is up, the magic goes away and the spell ends.
If a spell&rsquo;s duration is variable the duration is rolled secretly
(the caster doesn&rsquo;t know how long the spell will last). <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Instantaneous:</span> The spell energy comes and goes the instant the spell is cast, though the consequences might be long-lasting.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Permanent:</span> The energy remains as long as the effect does. This means the spell is vulnerable to dispel magic. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Concentration:</span> The spell
lasts as long as you concentrate on it. Concentrating to maintain a
spell is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of
opportunity. Anything that could break your concentration when casting
a spell can also break your concentration while you&rsquo;re
maintaining one, causing the spell to end.<br>
      <br>
You can&rsquo;t cast a spell while concentrating on another one.
Sometimes a spell lasts for a short time after you cease concentrating.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Subjects, Effects, and Areas:</span>
If the spell affects creatures directly the result travels with the
subjects for the spell&rsquo;s duration. If the spell creates an
effect, the effect lasts for the duration. The effect might move or
remain still. Such an effect can be destroyed prior to when its
duration ends. If the spell affects an area then the spell stays with
that area for its duration. <br>
      <br>
Creatures become subject to the spell when they enter the area and are no longer subject to it when they leave.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Touch Spells and Holding the Charge:</span>
In most cases, if you don&rsquo;t discharge a touch spell on the round
you cast it, you can hold the charge (postpone the discharge of the
spell) indefinitely. You can make touch attacks round after round. If
you cast another spell, the touch spell dissipates.<br>
      <br>
Some touch spells allow you to touch multiple targets as part of the
spell. You can&rsquo;t hold the charge of such a spell; you must touch
all targets of the spell in the same round that you finish casting the
spell.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Discharge: </span>Occasionally a spells lasts for a set duration or until triggered or discharged.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(D) Dismissible:</span> If the
Duration line ends with &ldquo;(D),&rdquo; you can dismiss the spell at
will. You must be within range of the spell&rsquo;s effect and must
speak words of dismissal, which are usually a modified form of the
spell&rsquo;s verbal component. If the spell has no verbal component,
you can dismiss the effect with a gesture. Dismissing a spell is a
standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.<br>
      <br>
A spell that depends on concentration is dismissible by its very
nature, and dismissing it does not take an action, since all you have
to do to end the spell is to stop concentrating on your turn.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw: </span>Usually a
harmful spell allows a target to make a saving throw to avoid some or
all of the effect. The Saving Throw entry in a spell description
defines which type of saving throw the spell allows and describes how
saving throws against the spell work.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Negates:</span> The spell has no effect on a subject that makes a successful saving throw.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Partial:</span> The spell causes an effect on its subject. A successful saving throw means that some lesser effect occurs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Half:</span> The spell deals damage, and a successful saving throw halves the damage taken (round down).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">None: </span>No saving throw is allowed.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Disbelief:</span> A successful save lets the subject ignore the effect. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(object):</span> The spell can
be cast on objects, which receive saving throws only if they are
magical or if they are attended (held, worn, grasped, or the like) by a
creature resisting the spell, in which case the object uses the
creature&rsquo;s saving throw bonus unless its own bonus is greater.
(This notation does not mean that a spell can be cast only on objects.
Some spells of this sort can be cast on creatures or objects.) A magic
item&rsquo;s saving throw bonuses are each equal to 2 + one-half the
item&rsquo;s caster level. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(harmless):</span> The spell is usually beneficial, not harmful, but a targeted creature can attempt a saving throw if it desires.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving Throw Difficulty Class:</span>
A saving throw against your spell has a DC of 10 + the level of the
spell + your bonus for the relevant ability (Intelligence for a wizard,
Charisma for a sorcerer or bard, or Wisdom for a cleric, druid,
paladin, or ranger). A spell&rsquo;s level can vary depending on your
class. Always use the spell level applicable to your class.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Succeeding on a Saving Throw:</span>
A creature that successfully saves against a spell that has no obvious
physical effects feels a hostile force or a tingle, but cannot deduce
the exact nature of the attack. Likewise, if a creature&rsquo;s saving
throw succeeds against a targeted spell you sense that the spell has
failed. You do not sense when creatures succeed on saves against effect
and area spells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Automatic Failures and Successes:</span>
A natural 1 (the d20 comes up 1) on a saving throw is always a failure,
and the spell may cause damage to exposed items (see Items Surviving
after a Saving Throw, below). A natural 20 (the d20 comes up 20) is
always a success.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Voluntarily Giving up a Saving Throw:</span>
A creature can voluntarily forego a saving throw and willingly accept a
spell&rsquo;s result. Even a character with a special resistance to
magic can suppress this quality.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Items Surviving after a Saving Throw: </span>Unless
the descriptive text for the spell specifies otherwise, all items
carried or worn by a creature are assumed to survive a magical attack.
If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw against the effect,
however, an exposed item is harmed (if the attack can harm objects).
Refer to Table: Items Affected by Magical Attacks. Determine which four
objects carried or worn by the creature are most likely to be affected
and roll randomly among them. The randomly determined item must make a
saving throw against the attack form and take whatever damage the
attack deal.<br>
      <br>
If an item is not carried or worn and is not magical, it does not get a saving throw. It simply is dealt the appropriate damage.<br>

      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Spell Resistance:</span> Spell
resistance is a special defensive ability. If your spell is being
resisted by a creature with spell resistance, you must make a caster
level check (1d20 + caster level) at least equal to the
creature&rsquo;s spell resistance for the spell to affect that
creature. The defender&rsquo;s spell resistance is like an Armor Class
against magical attacks. Include any adjustments to your caster level
to this caster level check.<br>
      <br>
The Spell Resistance entry and the descriptive text of a spell
description tell you whether spell resistance protects creatures from
the spell. In many cases, spell resistance applies only when a
resistant creature is targeted by the spell, not when a resistant
creature encounters a spell that is already in place.<br>
      <br>
The terms &ldquo;object&rdquo; and &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; mean the same
thing for spell resistance as they do for saving throws. A creature
with spell resistance must voluntarily lower the resistance (a standard
action) in order to be affected by a spell noted as harmless. In such a
case, you do not need to make the caster level check described above.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Descriptive Text: </span>This
portion of a spell description details what the spell does and how it
works. If one of the previous entries in the description included
&ldquo;see text,&rdquo; this is where the explanation is found. </td>
