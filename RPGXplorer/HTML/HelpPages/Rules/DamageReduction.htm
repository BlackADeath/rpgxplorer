				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">Some magic creatures have the
supernatural ability to instantly heal damage from weapons or to ignore
blows altogether as though they were invulnerable.<br>

      <br>

The numerical part of a creature&rsquo;s damage reduction is the amount
of hit points the creature ignores from normal attacks. Usually, a
certain type of weapon can overcome this reduction. This information is
separated from the damage reduction number by a slash. Damage reduction
may be overcome by special materials, by magic weapons (any weapon with
a +1 or higher enhancement bonus, not counting the enhancement from
masterwork quality), certain types of weapons (such as slashing or
bludgeoning), and weapons imbued with an alignment. If a dash follows
the slash then the damage reduction is effective against any attack
that does not ignore damage reduction.<br>

      <br>

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of
+1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming
damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon
with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon (in
addition to any alignment it may already have).<br>

      <br>

Whenever damage reduction completely negates the damage from an attack,
it also negates most special effects that accompany the attack, such as
injury type poison, a monk&rsquo;s stunning, and injury type disease.
Damage reduction does not negate touch attacks, energy damage dealt
along with an attack, or energy drains. Nor does it affect poisons or
diseases delivered by inhalation, ingestion, or contact. <br>

Attacks that deal no damage because of the target&rsquo;s damage reduction do not disrupt spells.<br>

      <br>

Spells, spell-like abilities, and energy attacks (even nonmagical fire) ignore damage reduction.<br>

      <br>

Sometimes damage reduction is instant healing. Sometimes damage
reduction represents the creature&rsquo;s tough hide or body. In
either case, characters can see that conventional attacks don&rsquo;t
work.<br>

      <br>

If a creature has damage reduction from more than one source, the two
forms of damage reduction do not stack. Instead, the creature gets the
benefit of the best damage reduction in a given situation.&nbsp; </td>
