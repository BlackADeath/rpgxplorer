      <p class="HelpText"><strong></strong><b>Prerequisite:</b>&nbsp;A
minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack
bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or a class
level that a character must have in order to acquire this feat. This
entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more
than one prerequisite.</p>

      <p class="HelpText">A character can
gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains the prerequisite.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> A character can't use a feat if
he or she has lost a prerequisite.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Benefit:</strong>&nbsp;What
the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do.
If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not
stack unless indicated otherwise in the description. In general, having
a feat twice is the same as having it once.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Normal:</strong>&nbsp;What
a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted
from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this
entry is absent.</p>

      <strong>Special:</strong>&nbsp;Additional
facts about the feat that may be helpful when you decide whether to
acquire the feat.
      <p class="HelpText"><strong>Types of
Feats:&nbsp;</strong>Some feats are general, meaning
that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation
feats, which allow spellcasters to create magic items of all sorts. A
metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater
effect, albeit as if the spell were a higher spell level than it
actually is.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Fighter Bonus Feats: </strong>Any
feat designated as a fighter feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus
feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes
from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet any prerequisites.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Item Creation Feats: </strong>An
item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a certain
type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various item
creation feats all have certain features in common.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>XP Cost:</strong>&nbsp;Experience
that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended when making a
magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the item in gold
pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item that he or she
loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level,
he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item rather than
keeping the XP to advance a level.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Raw Materials
Cost:</strong>&nbsp;The cost of creating a magic item equals
one-half the sale cost of the item. Using an item creation feat also
requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and
so on. A character generally has access to what he or she needs unless
unusual circumstances apply. Time: The time to create a magic item
depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one
day.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Item Cost:</strong>&nbsp;Brew
Potion, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly
reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their
caster level-that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would
have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items
(and thus the XP cost and the cost of the raw materials) also depends
on the caster level. The caster level must be high enough that the
spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find
the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell
level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below: Scrolls:
Base price = spell level x caster level x 25 gp.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Potions:</strong>&nbsp;Base
price = spell level x caster level x 50 gp. Wands: Base price = spell
level x caster level x 750 gp. A 0-level spell is considered to have a
spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Extra Costs:</strong>&nbsp;Any
potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material
component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For potions
and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or pay the
XP cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend
fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or
XP, as noted in their descriptions.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Metamagic Feats: </strong>As
a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast spells
in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells were
originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in such a
way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at least it
is possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot
higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the
DC for saving throws against it does not go up.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Wizards and
Divine Spellcasters:</strong>&nbsp;Wizards and divine
spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation,
the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and
thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Sorcerers and
Bards:</strong>&nbsp;Sorcerers and bards choose spells as
they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to
apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other
spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. But
because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic
form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot.
Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a
metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast
a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is 1 action,
casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or
bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) For a spell with
a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the
spell.</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Spontaneous
Casting and Metamagic Feats:</strong>&nbsp;A cleric
spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic
version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case.
Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round
action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra
full-round action to cast.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="HelpText"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Effects of</span> <strong>Metamagic
Feats on a Spell:</strong>&nbsp;In all ways, a metamagic
spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared
and cast as a higher-level spell. Saving throw modifications are not
changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description. The
modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by
the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a
spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device. Metamagic feats
that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of
opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However,
casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of
opportunity. Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the
specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't
modify.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell:</strong>&nbsp;A
spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell.
Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic
feat more than once to a single spell.<br>

      <br>

      <strong>Magic Items and Metamagic Spells:</strong>&nbsp;With
the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a
spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands
apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the
metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to
activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="HelpText"> <strong>Counterspelling
Metamagic Spells:</strong>&nbsp;Whether or not a spell has
been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to
counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell.<br>
