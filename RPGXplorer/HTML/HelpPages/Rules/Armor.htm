      <p>
						To wear heavier armor effectively, a character can select the Armor Proficiency 
						feats, but most classes are automatically proficient with the armors that work 
						best for them.<br>


						Armor and shields can take damage from some types of attacks.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;This column gives the weight of the armor sized 
						for a Medium wearer. Armor fitted for Small characters weighs half as much, and 
						armor for Large characters weighs twice as much.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Cost:</strong> The cost of the armor for Small or Medium humanoid 
						creatures. See Armor for Unusual Creatures, below, for armor prices for other 
						creatures.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Training:</strong> The type of proficiency required to use this armor 
						or shield without penalty (see <a href="../Feats/Armor%20Proficiency%20%28light%29.htm">Armor 
							Proficiency (Light)</a>).</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>AC:</strong> Each armor grants an armor bonus to AC, while shields 
						grant a shield bonus to AC. The armor bonus from a suit of armor doesn't stack 
						with other effects or items that grant an armor bonus. Similarly, the shield 
						bonus from a shield doesn't stack with other effects that grant a shield bonus.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Maximum Dex Bonus:</strong> This number is the maximum Dexterity bonus 
						to AC that this type of armor allows. Heavier armors limit mobility, reducing 
						the wearer's ability to dodge blows. This restriction doesn't affect any other 
						Dexterity-related abilities.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						Even if a character's Dexterity bonus to AC drops to 0 because of armor, this 
						situation does not count as losing a Dexterity bonus to AC.<br>


						Your character's encumbrance (the amount of gear he or she carries) may also 
						restrict the maximum Dexterity bonus that can be applied to his or her Armor 
						Class.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Shields:</i>&nbsp;Shields do not affect a character's maximum Dexterity 
						bonus.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Armor Check Penalty:</strong> Any armor heavier than leather hurts a 
						character's ability to use some skills. An armor check penalty number is the 
						penalty that applies to Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Hide, Jump, Move 
						Silently, Sleight of Hand, and Tumble checks by a character wearing a certain 
						kind of armor. Double the normal armor check penalty is applied to Swim checks. 
						A character's encumbrance (the amount of gear carried, including armor) may 
						also apply an armor check penalty.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Shields:</i>&nbsp;If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, both 
						armor check penalties apply.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Nonproficient with Armor Worn:</i>&nbsp;A character who wears armor and/or 
						uses a shield with which he or she is not proficient takes the armor's (and/or 
						shield's) armor check penalty on attack rolls and on all Strength-based and 
						Dexterity-based ability and skill checks. The penalty for nonproficiency with 
						armor stacks with the penalty for nonproficiency with shields.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Sleeping in Armor:</i>&nbsp;A character who sleeps in medium or heavy armor 
						is automatically fatigued the next day. He or she takes a -2 penalty on 
						Strength and Dexterity and can't charge or run. Sleeping in light armor does 
						not cause fatigue.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Arcane Spell Failure:</strong> Armor interferes with the gestures that 
						a spellcaster must make to cast an arcane spell that has a somatic component. 
						Arcane spellcasters face the possibility of arcane spell failure if they're 
						wearing armor. Bards can wear light armor without incurring any arcane spell 
						failure chance for their bard spells.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Casting an Arcane Spell in Armor:</i>&nbsp;A character who casts an arcane 
						spell while wearing armor must usually make an arcane spell failure roll. The 
						number in the Arcane Spell Failure Chance column on Table: Armor and Shields is 
						the chance that the spell fails and is ruined. If the spell lacks a somatic 
						component, however, it can be cast with no chance of arcane spell failure.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<i>Shields:</i>&nbsp;If a character is wearing armor and using a shield, add 
						the two numbers together to get a single arcane spell failure chance.</p>


					
      
      <p>
						<strong>Speed: </strong>Medium or heavy armor slows the wearer down. Humans, 
						elves, half-elves, and half-orcs have an unencumbered speed of 30 feet. 
						Dwarves, gnomes, and halflings have an unencumbered speed of 20 feet. A revised 
						speed when wearing the armor is shown in a separate column for each of these 
						base speeds. Remember, however, that a dwarf 's land speed remains 20 feet even 
						in medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>

      
      <p>
						<i>Shields:</i> &nbsp;Shields do not affect a character's speed.<br>
