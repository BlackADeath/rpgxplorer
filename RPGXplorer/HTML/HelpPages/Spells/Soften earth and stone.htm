					Transmutation [Earth]<br>

      <strong>Level:</strong> Drd 2, Earth 2<br>

      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, DF<br>

      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>

      <strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br>

      <strong>Area:</strong> 10-ft. square/level; see text<br>

      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>

      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>


					<br>

When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the
spell's area is softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud, dry earth
becomes loose sand or dirt, and stone becomes soft clay that is easily
molded or chopped. You affect a 10-footsquare area to a depth of 1 to 4
feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that
spot. Magical, enchanted, dressed, or worked stone cannot be affected.
Earth or stone creatures are not affected.<br>

      <br>

A creature in mud must succeed on a Reflex save or be caught for 1d2
rounds and unable to move, attack, or cast spells. A creature that
succeeds on its save can move through the mud at half speed, and it
can't run or charge.<br>
      <br>

Loose dirt is not as troublesome as mud, but all creatures in the area
can move at only half their normal speed and can't run or charge over
the surface.<br>

      <br>

Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow
characters to cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able
to affect before.<br>

      <br>

While <i>soften earth and stone</i> does not affect dressed or worked
stone, cavern ceilings or vertical surfaces such as cliff faces can be
affected. Usually, this causes a moderate collapse or landslide as the
loosened material peels away from the face of the wall or roof and
falls.<br>

      <br>

A moderate amount of structural damage can be dealt to a manufactured
structure by softening the ground beneath it, causing it to settle.
However, most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell,
not destroyed.<br>
