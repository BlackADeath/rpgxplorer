					Necromancy<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 8<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M, F<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> 0 ft.<br>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> One clone<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>
This spell makes an inert duplicate of a creature. If the original
individual has been slain, its soul immediately transfers to the clone,
creating a replacement (provided that the soul is free and willing to
return). The original's physical remains, should they still exist,
become inert and cannot thereafter be restored to life. If the original
creature has reached the end of its natural life span (that is, it has
died of natural causes), any cloning attempt fails.<br>
      <br>
To create the duplicate, you must have a piece of flesh (not hair,
nails, scales, or the like) with a volume of at least 1 cubic inch that
was taken from the original creature's living body. The piece of flesh
need not be fresh, but it must be kept from rotting. Once the spell is
cast, the duplicate must be grown in a laboratory for 2d4 months.<br>
      <br>
When the clone is completed, the original's soul enters it immediately,
if that creature is already dead. The clone is physically identical
with the original and possesses the same personality and memories as
the original. In other respects, treat the clone as if it were the
original character raised from the dead, including the loss of one
level or 2 points of Constitution (if the original was a 1st-level
character). If this Constitution adjustment would give the clone a
Constitution score of 0, the spell fails. If the original creature has
lost levels since the flesh sample was taken and died at a lower level
than the clone would otherwise be, the clone is one level below the
level at which the original died.<br>
      <br>
The spell duplicates only the original's body and mind, not its equipment.<br>
      <br>
A duplicate can be grown while the original still lives, or when the
original soul is unavailable, but the resulting body is merely a
soulless bit of inert flesh, which rots if not preserved.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Material Component:</i> The piece of flesh and various laboratory supplies (cost 1,000 gp).<br>
      <br>
      <i>Focus:</i> Special laboratory equipment (cost 500 gp).<br>
