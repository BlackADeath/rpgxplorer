					Conjuration (Teleportation)<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 4, Travel 4<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> You and touched objects or other touched willing creatures<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None and Will negates (object)<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No and Yes (object)<br>

					<br>
You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other
spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot
desired-whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction.
After using this spell, you can't take any other actions until your
next turn. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't
exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing
Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum
load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature
counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large
creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in
contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be
in contact with you.<br>
      <br>
If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you
and each creature traveling with you take 1d6 points of damage and are
shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 100 feet of
the intended location.<br>
      <br>
If there is no free space within 100 feet, you and each creature
traveling with you take an additional 2d6 points of damage and are
shunted to a free space within 1,000 feet. If there is no free space
within 1,000 feet, you and each creature travelling with you take an
additional 4d6 points of damage and the spell simply fails.<br>
