					Divination<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> One mile<br>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> Ten or more levitating eyes<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour/level; see text (D)<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>
You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called
"eyes") equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout
around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye
can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions.<br>
      <br>
While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and
difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a
small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies
at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide
modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum
+15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors
that would affect your ability to receive visual information about your
surroundings. An eye traveling through darkness must find its way by
touch.<br>
      <br>
When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to
follow in a command of no more than twenty-five words. Any knowledge
you possess is known by the eyes as well.<br>
      <br>
In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand.
Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence. It
takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After
relaying its findings, an eye disappears. <br>
      <br>
If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases
to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know
if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of
some other event.<br>
      <br>
The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel magic</i>
can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area
dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall
or similar obstacle and destroy itself.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Material Component:</i> A handful of crystal marbles.<br>
