					Conjuration (Calling) [see text]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels); see text<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> One elemental or outsider with 6 HD or less<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No and Yes; see text<br>

					<br>
Casting this spell attempts a dangerous act: to lure a creature from
another plane to a specifically prepared trap, which must lie within
the spell's range. The called creature is held in the trap until it
agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom.<br>
      <br>
To create the trap, you must use a <i>magic circle</i> spell, focused
inward. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If
you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's
proper name in casting the spell.<br>
      <br>
The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw
succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails,
the creature is immediately drawn to the trap (spell resistance does
not keep it from being called). The creature can escape from the trap
with by successfully pitting its spell resistance against your caster
level check, by dimensional travel, or with a successful Charisma check
(DC 15 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier). It can try each
method once per day. If it breaks loose, it can flee or attack you. A <i>dimensional anchor</i> cast on the creature prevents its escape via dimensional travel. You can also employ a calling diagram (see <i>magic circle against evil</i>) to make the trap more secure.<br>
      <br>
If the creature does not break free of the trap, you can keep it bound
for as long as you dare. You can attempt to compel the creature to
perform a service by describing the service and perhaps offering some
sort of reward. You make a Charisma check opposed by the creature's
Charisma check. The check is assigned a bonus of +0 to +6 based on the
nature of the service and the reward. If the creature wins the opposed
check, it refuses service. New offers, bribes, and the like can be made
or the old ones reoffered every 24 hours. This process can be repeated
until the creature promises to serve, until it breaks free, or until
you decide to get rid of it by means of some other spell. Impossible
demands or unreasonable commands are never agreed to. If you roll a 1
on the Charisma check, the creature breaks free of the binding and can
escape or attack you.<br>
      <br>
Once the requested service is completed, the creature need only so
inform you to be instantly sent back whence it came. The creature might
later seek revenge. If you assign some open-ended task that the
creature cannot complete though its own actions the spell remains in
effect for a maximum of one day per caster level, and the creature
gains an immediate chance to break free. Note that a clever recipient
can subvert some instructions.<br>
When you use a calling spell to call an air, chaotic, earth, evil,
fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a spell of that type. <br>
