					Transmutation<br>

      <strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5<br>

      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>

      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>

      <strong>Range:</strong> Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)<br>

      <strong>Target or Targets:</strong> See text<br>

      <strong>Duration:</strong> Concentration (up to 1 round/ level) or instantaneous; see text<br>

      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (object) or None; see text<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (object); see text<br>


					<br>

You move objects or creatures by concentrating on them. Depending on
the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force,
perform a variety of combat maneuvers, or exert a single short, violent
thrust.<br>
      <br>

      <i>Sustained Force:</i> A sustained force moves an object
weighing no more than 25 pounds per caster level (maximum 375 pounds at
15th level) up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate the effect
on an object it possesses with a successful Will save or with spell
resistance.<br>

      <br>

This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level, but it
ends if you cease concentration. The weight can be moved vertically,
horizontally, or in both directions. An object cannot be moved beyond
your range. The spell ends if the object is forced beyond the range. If
you cease concentration for any reason, the object falls or stops.<br>

      <br>

An object can be telekinetically manipulated as if with one hand. For
example, a lever or rope can be pulled, a key can be turned, an object
rotated, and so on, if the force required is within the weight
limitation. You might even be able to untie simple knots, though
delicate activities such as these require Intelligence checks.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Combat Maneuver:</i> Alternatively, once per round, you can use <i>telekinesis</i>
to perform a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip.
Resolve these attempts as normal, except that they don't provoke
attacks of opportunity, you use your caster level in place of your base
attack bonus (for disarm and grapple), you use your Intelligence
modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a sorcerer) in place of
your Strength or Dexterity modifier, and a failed attempt doesn't allow
a reactive attempt by the target (such as for disarm or trip). No save
is allowed against these attempts, but spell resistance applies
normally. This version of the spell can last 1 round per caster level,
but it ends if you cease concentration.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Violent Thrust:</i> Alternatively, the spell energy can be
spent in a single round. You can hurl one object or creature per caster
level (maximum 15) that are within range and all within 10 feet of each
other toward any target within 10 feet per level of all the objects.
You can hurl up to a total weight of 25 pounds per caster level
(maximum 375 pounds at 15th level).<br>

      <br>

You must succeed on attack rolls (one per creature or object thrown) to
hit the target with the items, using your base attack bonus + your
Intelligence modifier (if a wizard) or Charisma modifier (if a
sorcerer). Weapons cause standard damage (with no Strength bonus; note
that arrows or bolts deal damage as daggers of their size when used in
this manner). Other objects cause damage ranging from 1 point per 25
pounds (for less dangerous objects) to 1d6 points of damage per 25
pounds (for hard, dense objects).<br>

      <br>

Creatures who fall within the weight capacity of the spell can be
hurled, but they are allowed Will saves (and spell resistance) to
negate the effect, as are those whose held possessions are targeted by
the spell. If a telekinesed creature is hurled against a solid surface,
it takes damage as if it had fallen 10 feet (1d6 points).<br>
