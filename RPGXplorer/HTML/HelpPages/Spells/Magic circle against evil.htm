					Abjuration [Good]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 3, Good 3, Pal 3, Sor/Wiz 3<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M/DF<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Area:</strong> 10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates (harmless)<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No; see text<br>

					<br>

					All creatures within the area gain the effects of a <i>protection from evil</i>
spell, and no nongood summoned creatures can enter the area either. You
must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay
(as in the third function of <i>protection from evil</i>), but the
deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental
control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.<br>
      <br>
This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A <i>magic circle against evil</i>
can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the
spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i>lesser planar binding, planar binding,</i> and <i>greater planar binding</i>
spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you
cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>.
The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too
large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the
spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.<br>
      <br>
A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the
circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is
broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do
nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other
creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test
the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the
creature breaks free, destroying the circle. A creature capable of any
form of dimensional travel (<i>astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport,</i>
and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through that means.
You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle,</i>
but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and
the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its
ranged attacks except for the circle itself.<br>
      <br>
You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no
gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to
make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand
takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know
the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is
ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under
no particular time pressure to complete the task. This task also takes
10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours
and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.<br>
      <br>
A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional anchor</i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i>
prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross
the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of
the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC
increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything
disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. However, the creature
itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as
noted above.<br>
      <br>
This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A little powdered silver with
which you trace a 3-footdiameter circle on the floor (or ground) around
the creature to be warded.<br>
