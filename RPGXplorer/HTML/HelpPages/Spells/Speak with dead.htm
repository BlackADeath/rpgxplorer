					Necromancy [Language-Dependent]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 3<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, DF<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft.<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> One dead creature<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1 min./level<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates; see text<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>
You grant the semblance of life and intellect to a corpse, allowing it
to answer several questions that you put to it. You may ask one
question per two caster levels. Unasked questions are wasted if the
duration expires. The corpse's knowledge is limited to what the
creature knew during life, including the languages it spoke (if any).
Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive. If the creature's
alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to
resist the spell as if it were alive.<br>
      <br>
If the corpse has been subject to <i>speak with dead</i> within the
past week, the new spell fails. You can cast this spell on a corpse
that has been deceased for any amount of time, but the body must be
mostly intact to be able to respond. A damaged corpse may be able to
give partial answers or partially correct answers, but it must at least
have a mouth in order to speak at all. <br>
      <br>
This spell does not let you actually speak to the person (whose soul
has departed). It instead draws on the imprinted knowledge stored in
the corpse. The partially animated body retains the imprint of the soul
that once inhabited it, and thus it can speak with all the knowledge
that the creature had while alive. The corpse, however, cannot learn
new information.<br>
      <br>
Indeed, it can't even remember being questioned.<br>
      <br>
This spell does not affect a corpse that has been turned into an undead creature.<br>
