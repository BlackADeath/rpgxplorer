					Conjuration (Creation) [Fire]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Drd 6, Fire 6, Sun 6<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Targets:</strong> Up to four touched acorns or up to eight touched holly berries<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level or until used<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None or Reflex half; see text<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>

					Depending on the version of <i>fire seeds</i> you choose, you
turn acorns into splash weapons that you or another character can
throw, or you turn holly berries into bombs that you can detonate on
command.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Acorn Grenades:</i> As many as four acorns turn into special
splash weapons that can be hurled as far as 100 feet. A ranged touch
attack roll is required to strike the intended target. Together, the
acorns are capable of dealing 1d6 points of fire damage per caster
level (maximum 20d6), divided up among the acorns as you wish.<br>
      <br>
Each acorn explodes upon striking any hard surface. In addition to its
regular fire damage, it deals 1 point of splash damage per die, and it
ignites any combustible materials within 10 feet. A creature within
this area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half
damage; a creature struck directly is not allowed a saving throw.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Holly Berry Bombs:</i> You turn as many as eight holly berries
into special bombs. The holly berries are usually placed by hand, since
they are too light to make effective thrown weapons (they can be tossed
only 5 feet). If you are within 200 feet and speak a word of command,
each berry instantly bursts into flame, causing 1d8 points of fire
damage +1 point per caster level to every creature in a 5-foot radius
burst and igniting any combustible materials within 5 feet. A creature
in the area that makes a successful Reflex saving throw takes only half
damage.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Material Component:</i> The acorns or holly berries.<br>
