					Abjuration [Good]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 1, Good 1, Pal 1, Sor/Wiz 1<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M/DF<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> Creature touched<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No; see text<br>

					<br>
This spell wards a creature from attacks by evil creatures, from mental
control, and from summoned creatures. It creates a magical barrier
around the subject at a distance of 1 foot. The barrier moves with the
subject and has three major effects.<br>
      <br>
First, the subject gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC and a +2
resistance bonus on saves. Both these bonuses apply against attacks
made or effects created by evil creatures.<br>
      <br>
Second, the barrier blocks any attempt to possess the warded creature (by a <i>magic jar</i>
attack, for example) or to exercise mental control over the creature
(including enchantment (charm) effects and enchantment (compulsion)
effects that grant the caster ongoing control over the subject, such as
      <i>dominate person</i>). The protection does not prevent such
effects from targeting the protected creature, but it suppresses the
effect for the duration of the <i>protection from evil</i> effect. If the <i>protection from evil</i>
effect ends before the effect granting mental control does, the
would-be controller would then be able to mentally command the
controlled creature. Likewise, the barrier keeps out a possessing life
force but does not expel one if it is in place before the spell is
cast. This second effect works regardless of alignment.<br>
      <br>
Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by summoned creatures. This
causes the natural weapon attacks of such creatures to fail and the
creatures to recoil if such attacks require touching the warded
creature. Good summoned creatures are immune to this effect. The
protection against contact by summoned creatures ends if the warded
creature makes an attack against or tries to force the barrier against
the blocked creature. Spell resistance can allow a creature to overcome
this protection and touch the warded creature.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A little powdered silver with
which you trace a 3-foot -diameter circle on the floor (or ground)
around the creature to be warded.<br>
