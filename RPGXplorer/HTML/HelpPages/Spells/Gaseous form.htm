					Transmutation<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Air 3, Brd 3, Sor/Wiz 3<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> S, M/DF<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> Willing corporeal creature touched<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

The subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and
translucent. Its material armor (including natural armor) becomes
worthless, though its size, Dexterity, deflection bonuses, and armor
bonuses from force effects still apply. The subject gains damage
reduction 10/magic and becomes immune to poison and critical hits. It
can't attack or cast spells with verbal, somatic, material, or focus
components while in gaseous form. (This does not rule out the use of
certain spells that the subject may have prepared using the feats
Silent Spell, Still Spell, and Eschew Materials.) The subject also
loses supernatural abilities while in gaseous form. If it has a touch
spell ready to use, that spell is discharged harmlessly when the <i>gaseous form</i> spell takes effect.<br>
      <br>
A gaseous creature can't run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet
(maneuverability perfect). It can pass through small holes or narrow
openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its
hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the
effects of wind, and it can't enter water or other liquid. It also
can't manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along
with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though
in some cases their effects may be moot.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Arcane Material Component:</i> A bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke.<br>
