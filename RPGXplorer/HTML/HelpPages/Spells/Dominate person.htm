					Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 4, Sor/Wiz 5<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 round<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> One humanoid<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> One day/level<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>

					<br>

					You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind.<br>
      <br>
If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force
the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its
abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic
commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still."
You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive
direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you
telepathically.<br>
      <br>
Once you have given a <i>dominated</i> creature a command, it continues
to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other
activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as
sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of
activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can
determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an
enchantment effect (see the Sense Motive skill description).<br>
      <br>
Changing your instructions or giving a <i>dominated</i> creature a new command is the equivalent of redirecting a spell, so it is a move action.<br>
      <br>
By concentrating fully on the spell (a standard action), you can
receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject,
though it still can't communicate with you. You can't actually see
through the subject's eyes, so it's not as good as being there
yourself, but you still get a good idea of what's going on.<br>
      <br>
Subjects resist this control, and any subject forced to take actions
against its nature receives a new saving throw with a +2 bonus.
Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is
established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited, as
long as you and the subject are on the same plane. You need not see the
subject to control it.<br>
      <br>
If you don't spend at least 1 round concentrating on the spell each
day, the subject receives a new saving throw to throw off the
domination.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Protection from evil</i> or a similar spell can prevent you
from exercising control or using the telepathic link while the subject
is so warded, but such an effect neither prevents the establishment of
domination nor dispels it.<br>
