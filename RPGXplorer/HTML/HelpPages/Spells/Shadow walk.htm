					Illusion (Shadow)<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 5, Sor/Wiz 6<br>

      <strong>Targets:</strong> Up to one touched creature/ level<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>

					To use the <i>shadow walk</i> spell, you must be in an area of
shadowy illumination. You and any creature you touch are then
transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the
Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is
largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than
one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must
be touching each other.<br>
      <br>
In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour,
moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more
rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to
travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired
distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.<br>
      <br>
Because of the blurring of reality between the Plane of Shadow and the
Material Plane, you can't make out details of the terrain or areas you
pass over during transit, nor can you predict perfectly where your
travel will end. It's impossible to judge distances accurately, making
the spell virtually useless for scouting or spying. Furthermore, when
the spell effect ends, you are shunted 1d10x100 feet in a random
horizontal direction from your desired endpoint. If this would place
you within a solid object, you are shunted 1d10x1,000 feet in the same
direction. If this would still place you within a solid object, you
(and any creatures with you) are shunted to the nearest empty space
available, but the strain of this activity renders each creature
fatigued (no save).<br>
      <br>
      <i>Shadow walk</i> can also be used to travel to other planes
that border on the Plane of Shadow, but this usage requires the transit
of the Plane of Shadow to arrive at a border with another plane of
reality. The transit of the Plane of Shadow requires 1d4 hours.<br>
      <br>
Any creatures touched by you when <i>shadow walk</i> is cast also make the transition to the borders of the Plane of Shadow.<br>
      <br>
They may opt to follow you, wander off through the plane, or stumble
back into the Material Plane (50% chance for either of the latter
results if they are lost or abandoned by you). Creatures unwilling to
accompany you into the Plane of Shadow receive a Will saving throw,
negating the effect if successful.<br>
