					Conjuration (Calling) [see text]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 4<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, DF, XP<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br>
      <strong>Effect:</strong> One called elemental or outsider of 6 HD or less<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>
By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental
or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no
particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature
sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual
creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name
during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway).<br>
      <br>
You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment
from you. Tasks might range from the simple to the complex. You must be
able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for
its services.<br>
      <br>
The creature called requires a payment for its services. This payment
can take a variety of forms, from donating gold or magic items to an
allied temple, to a gift given directly to the creature, to some other
action on your part that matches the creature's alignment and goals.
Regardless, this payment must be made before the creature agrees to
perform any services. The bargaining takes at least 1 round, so any
actions by the creature begin in the round after it arrives.<br>
      <br>
A task taking up to 1 minute per caster level requires a payment of 100
gp per HD of the creature called. For a task taking up to 1 hour per
caster level, the creature requires a payment of 500 gp per HD. A
long-term task, one requiring up to one day per caster level, requires
a payment of 1,000 gp per HD.<br>
      <br>
A nonhazardous task requires only half the indicated payment, while an
especially hazardous task might require a greater gift. Few if any
creatures will accept a task that seems suicidal (remember, a called
creature actually dies when it is killed, unlike a summoned creature).
However, if the task is strongly aligned with the creature's ethos, it
may halve or even waive the payment. <br>
      <br>
At the end of its task, or when the duration bargained for expires, the
creature returns to its home plane (after reporting back to you, if
appropriate and possible).<br>
      <br>
      <i>Note:</i> When you use a calling spell that calls an air,
chaotic, earth, evil, fire, good, lawful, or water creature, it is a
spell of that type.<br>
      <br>
      <i>XP Cost:</i> 100 XP.<br>
