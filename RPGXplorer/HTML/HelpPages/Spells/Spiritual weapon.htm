					Evocation [Force]<br>

      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 2, War 2<br>

      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, DF<br>

      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>

      <strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br>

      <strong>Effect:</strong> Magic weapon of force<br>

      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1 round/level (D)<br>

      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>

      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>


					<br>

A weapon made of pure force springs into existence and attacks
opponents at a distance, as you direct it, dealing 1d8 force damage per
hit, +1 point per three caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The
weapon takes the shape of a weapon favored by your deity or a weapon
with some spiritual significance or symbolism to you (see below) and
has the same threat range and critical multipliers as a real weapon of
its form. It strikes the opponent you designate, starting with one
attack in the round the spell is cast and continuing each round
thereafter on your turn. It uses your base attack bonus (possibly
allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your
Wisdom modifier as its attack bonus. It strikes as a spell, not as a
weapon, so, for example, it can damage creatures that have damage
reduction. As a force effect, it can strike incorporeal creatures
without the normal miss chance associated with incorporeality. The
weapon always strikes from your direction. It does not get a flanking
bonus or help a combatant get one. Your feats or combat actions do not
affect the weapon. If the weapon goes beyond the spell range, if it
goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the weapon
returns to you and hovers.<br>

      <br>

Each round after the first, you can use a move action to redirect the
weapon to a new target. If you do not, the weapon continues to attack
the previous round's target. On any round that the weapon switches
targets, it gets one attack. Subsequent rounds of attacking that target
allow the weapon to make multiple attacks if your base attack bonus
would allow it to. Even if the <i>spiritual weapon</i> is a ranged
weapon, use the spell's range, not the weapon's normal range increment,
and switching targets still is a move action.<br>

      <br>

A <i>spiritual weapon</i> cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but <i>dispel magic</i>, <i>disintegrate</i>, a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. A <i>spiritual weapon</i>'s AC against touch attacks is 12 (10 + size bonus for Tiny object).<br>

      <br>

If an attacked creature has spell resistance, you make a caster level
check (1d20 + caster level) against that spell resistance the first
time the <i>spiritual weapon</i> strikes it. If the weapon is
successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the weapon has
its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.<br>

      <br>

The weapon that you get is often a force replica of your deity's own
personal weapon. A cleric without a deity gets a weapon based on his
alignment. A neutral cleric without a deity can create a <i>spiritual weapon</i>
of any alignment, provided he is acting at least generally in accord
with that alignment at the time. The weapons associated with each
alignment are as follows.<br>

      
      <ul>

        <li><i>Chaos:</i> Battleaxe</li>

        <li><i>Evil:</i> Light flail</li>

        <li><i>Good:</i> Warhammer</li>

        <li><i>Law:</i> Longsword</li>

      
      </ul>
