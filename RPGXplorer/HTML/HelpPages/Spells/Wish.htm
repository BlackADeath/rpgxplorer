      <i>Wish</i> is the mightiest spell a wizard or
sorcerer can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to
better suit you.<br>

      <br>

Even <i>wish</i>, however, has its limits.<br>

      <br>

A <i>wish</i> can produce any one of the following effects.<br>

      <ul>

        <li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 8th level
or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>

        <li>Duplicate any other spell of 6th level or lower,
provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you.</li>

        <li>Duplicate any wizard or sorcerer spell of 7th level
or lower even if it's of a prohibited school.</li>

        <li>Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower even
if it's of a prohibited school. </li>

        <li>Undo the harmful effects of many other spells, such
as <i>geas/quest</i> or <i>insanity</i>.</li>

        <li>Create a nonmagical item of up to 25,000 gp in value.</li>

        <li>Create a magic item, or add to the powers of an
existing magic item.</li>

        <li>Grant a creature a +1 inherent bonus to an ability
score. Two to five <i>wish</i> spells cast in immediate
succession can grant a creature a +2 to +5 inherent bonus to an ability
score (two wishes for a +2 inherent bonus, three for a +3 inherent
bonus, and so on). Inherent bonuses are instantaneous, so they cannot
be dispelled. <i>Note:</i> An inherent bonus may not
exceed +5 for a single ability score, and inherent bonuses to a
particular ability score do not stack, so only the best one applies.</li>

        <li>Remove injuries and afflictions. A single <i>wish</i>
can aid one creature per caster level, and all subjects are cured of
the same kind of affliction. For example, you could heal all the damage
you and your companions have taken, or remove all poison effects from
everyone in the party, but not do both with the same <i>wish</i>.
A <i>wish</i> can never restore the experience point loss
from casting a spell or the level or Constitution loss from being
raised from the dead.</li>

        <li>Revive the dead. A <i>wish</i> can bring
a dead creature back to life by duplicating a <i>resurrection</i>
spell. A <i>wish</i> can revive a dead creature whose body
has been destroyed, but the task takes two <i>wishes,</i>
one to recreate the body and another to infuse the body with life
again. A <i>wish</i> cannot prevent a character who was
brought back to life from losing an experience level.</li>

        <li>Transport travelers. A <i>wish</i> can
lift one creature per caster level from anywhere on any plane and place
those creatures anywhere else on any plane regardless of local
conditions. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the effect,
and spell resistance (if any) applies.</li>

        <li>Undo misfortune. A <i>wish</i> can undo
a single recent event. The <i>wish</i> forces a reroll of
any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality
reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a <i>wish</i> could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's successful critical
hit (either the attack roll or the critical roll), a friend's failed
save, and so on. The reroll, however, may be as bad as or worse than
the original roll. An unwilling target gets a Will save to negate the
effect, and spell resistance (if any) applies.
        </li>

      </ul>


You may try to use a <i>wish</i> to produce greater
effects than these, but doing so is dangerous. (The <i>wish</i>
may pervert your intent into a literal but undesirable fulfillment or
only a partial fulfillment.)<br>
      <br>

Duplicated spells allow saves and spell resistance as normal (but save
DCs are for 9th-level spells).<br>
      <br>

      <i>Material Component:</i> When a <i>wish</i>
duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than
10,000 gp, you must provide that component.<br>
      <br>

      <i>XP Cost:</i> The minimum XP cost for casting <i>wish</i>
is 5,000 XP. When a <i>wish</i> duplicates a spell that
has an XP cost, you must pay 5,000 XP or that cost, whichever is more.
When a <i>wish</i> creates or improves a magic item, you
must pay twice the normal XP cost for crafting or improving the item,
plus an additional 5,000 XP.<br>
