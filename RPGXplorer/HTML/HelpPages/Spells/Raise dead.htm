					Conjuration (Healing)<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 5<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M, DF<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> Dead creature touched<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Instantaneous<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None; see text<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes (harmless)<br>

					<br>
You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that
has been dead for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition,
the subject's soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject's
soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a
subject that wants to return receives no saving throw.<br>
      <br>
Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses
one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a
level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is
1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would
reduce its Con to 0 or less, it can't be raised). This level/HD loss or
Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died
with spells prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon
being raised, in addition to losing spells for losing a level. A
spellcasting creature that doesn't prepare spells (such as a sorcerer)
has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had
been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing spell slots for losing
a level.<br>
      <br>
A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit
Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal poison
and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but
magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes
mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the
creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still
missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead
creature's equipment or possessions are affected in any way by this
spell.<br>
      <br>
A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a
death effect can't be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals,
outsiders, and undead creatures can't be raised. The spell cannot bring
back a creature that has died of old age.<br>
