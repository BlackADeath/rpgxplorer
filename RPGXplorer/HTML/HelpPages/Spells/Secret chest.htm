					Conjuration (Summoning)<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Sor/Wiz 5<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, F<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 10 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> See text<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> One chest and up to 1 cu. ft. of goods/caster level<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> Sixty days or until discharged<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> No<br>

					<br>
You hide a chest on the Ethereal Plane for as long as sixty days and
can retrieve it at will. The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of
material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which
is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet). If any living creatures are in
the chest, there is a 75% chance that the spell simply fails. Once the
chest is hidden, you can retrieve it by concentrating (a standard
action), and it appears next to you.<br>
      <br>
The chest must be exceptionally well crafted and expensive, constructed
for you by master crafters. The cost of such a chest is never less than
5,000 gp. Once it is constructed, you must make a tiny replica (of the
same materials and perfect in every detail), so that the miniature of
the chest appears to be a perfect copy. (The replica costs 50 gp.) You
can have but one pair of these chests at any given time-even a <i>wish</i>
spell does not allow more. The chests are nonmagical and can be fitted
with locks, wards, and so on, just as any normal chest can be.<br>
      <br>
To hide the chest, you cast the spell while touching both the chest and
the replica. The chest vanishes into the Ethereal Plane. You need the
replica to recall the chest. After sixty days, there is a cumulative
chance of 5% per day that the chest is irretrievably lost. If the
miniature of the chest is lost or destroyed, there is no way, not even
with a <i>wish</i> spell, that the large chest can be summoned back, although an extraplanar expedition might be mounted to find it.<br>
      <br>
Living things in the chest eat, sleep, and age normally, and they die
if they run out of food, air, water, or whatever they need to survive.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Focus:</i> The chest and its replica.
