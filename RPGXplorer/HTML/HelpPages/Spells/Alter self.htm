					Transmutation<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 2, Sor/Wiz 2<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 standard action<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Personal<br>
      <strong>Target:</strong> You<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 10 min./level (D)<br>

					<br>
You assume the form of a creature of the same type as your normal form.
The new form must be within one size category of your normal size. The
maximum HD of an assumed form is equal to your caster level, to a
maximum of 5 HD at 5th level. You can change into a member of your own
kind or even into yourself.<br>
      <br>
You retain your own ability scores. Your class and level, hit points,
alignment, base attack bonus, and base save bonuses all remain the
same. You retain all supernatural and spell-like special attacks and
qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part
that the new form does not have (such as a mouth for a breath weapon or
eyes for a gaze attack).<br>
      <br>
You keep all extraordinary special attacks and qualities derived from
class levels, but you lose any from your normal form that are not
derived from class levels.<br>
      <br>
If the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You
retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the
new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language)
to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine
manipulation to use somatic or material components.<br>
      <br>
You acquire the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your
own mind. Physical qualities include natural size, mundane movement
capabilities (such as burrowing, climbing, walking, swimming, and
flight with wings, to a maximum speed of 120 feet for flying or 60 feet
for nonflying movement), natural armor bonus, natural weapons (such as
claws, bite, and so on), racial skill bonuses, racial bonus feats, and
any gross physical qualities (presence or absence of wings, number of
extremities, and so forth). A body with extra limbs does not allow you
to make more attacks (or more advantageous two-weapon attacks) than
normal.<br>
      <br>
You do not gain any extraordinary special attacks or special qualities
not noted above under physical qualities, such as darkvision, low-light
vision, blindsense, blindsight, fast healing, regeneration, scent, and
so forth.<br>
      <br>
You do not gain any supernatural special attacks, special qualities, or
spell-like abilities of the new form. Your creature type and subtype
(if any) remain the same regardless of your new form. You cannot take
the form of any creature with a template, even if that template doesn't
change the creature type or subtype.<br>
      <br>
You can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such
as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges
for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical
qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your
control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind.
You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's
race. If you use this spell to create a disguise, you get a +10 bonus
on your Disguise check.<br>
      <br>
When the change occurs, your equipment, if any, either remains worn or
held by the new form (if it is capable of wearing or holding the item),
or melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When you revert
to your true form, any objects previously melded into the new form
reappear in the same location on your body they previously occupied and
are once again functional. Any new items you wore in the assumed form
and can't wear in your normal form fall off and land at your feet; any
that you could wear in either form or carry in a body part common to
both forms at the time of reversion are still held in the same way. Any
part of the body or piece of equipment that is separated from the whole
reverts to its true form.<br>
