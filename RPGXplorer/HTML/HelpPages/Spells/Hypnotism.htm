					Enchantment (Compulsion) [Mind-Affecting]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 1, Sor/Wiz 1<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 round<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)<br>
      <strong>Area:</strong> Several living creatures, no two of which may be more than 30 ft. apart<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 2d4 rounds (D)<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>

					<br>
Your gestures and droning incantation fascinate nearby creatures,
causing them to stop and stare blankly at you. In addition, you can use
their rapt attention to make your suggestions and requests seem more
plausible. Roll 2d4 to see how many total Hit Dice of creatures you
affect. Creatures with fewer HD are affected before creatures with more
HD. Only creatures that can see or hear you are affected, but they do
not need to understand you to be fascinated.<br>
      <br>
If you use this spell in combat, each target gains a +2 bonus on its
saving throw. If the spell affects only a single creature not in combat
at the time, the saving throw has a penalty of -2.<br>
      <br>
While the subject is fascinated by this spell, it reacts as though it
were two steps more friendly in attitude. This allows you to make a
single request of the affected creature (provided you can communicate
with it). The request must be brief and reasonable. Even after the
spell ends, the creature retains its new attitude toward you, but only
with respect to that particular request.<br>
      <br>
A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that you enspelled it.<br>
