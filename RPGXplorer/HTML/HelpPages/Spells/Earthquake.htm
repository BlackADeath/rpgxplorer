					When you cast <i>earthquake</i>, an intense but highly localized
tremor rips the ground. The shock knocks creatures down, collapses
structures, opens cracks in the ground, and more. The effect lasts for
1 round, during which time creatures on the ground can't move or
attack. A spellcaster on the ground must make a Concentration check (DC
20 + spell level) or lose any spell he or she tries to cast. The
earthquake affects all terrain, vegetation, structures, and creatures
in the area. The specific effect of an <i>earthquake</i> spell depends on the nature of the terrain where it is cast.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Cave, Cavern, or Tunnel:</i> The spell collapses the roof,
dealing 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage to any creature caught under
the cave-in (Reflex DC 15 half ) and pinning that creature beneath the
rubble (see below). An <i>earthquake</i> cast on the roof of a very large cavern could also endanger those outside the actual area but below the falling debris.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Cliffs:</i> <i>Earthquake</i> causes a cliff to crumble,
creating a landslide that travels horizontally as far as it fell
vertically. Any creature in the path takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning
damage (Reflex DC 15 half ) and is pinned beneath the rubble (see
below).<br>

      <br>

      <i>Open Ground:</i> Each creature standing in the area must make
a DC 15 Reflex save or fall down. Fissures open in the earth, and every
creature on the ground has a 25% chance to fall into one (Reflex DC 20
to avoid a fissure). At the end of the spell, all fissures grind shut,
killing any creatures still trapped within.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Structure:</i> Any structure standing on open ground takes 100
points of damage, enough to collapse a typical wooden or masonry
building, but not a structure built of stone or reinforced masonry.
Hardness does not reduce this damage, nor is it halved as damage dealt
to objects normally is. Any creature caught inside a collapsing
structure takes 8d6 points of bludgeoning damage (Reflex DC 15 half )
and is pinned beneath the rubble (see below).<br>
      <br>

      <i>River, Lake, or Marsh:</i> Fissures open underneath the water,
draining away the water from that area and forming muddy ground. Soggy
marsh or swampland becomes quicksand for the duration of the spell,
sucking down creatures and structures. Each creature in the area must
make a DC 15 Reflex save or sink down in the mud and quicksand. At the
end of the spell, the rest of the body of water rushes in to replace
the drained water, possibly drowning those caught in the mud.<br>

      <br>

      <i>Pinned beneath Rubble:</i> Any creature pinned beneath rubble
takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute while pinned. If a
pinned character falls unconscious, he or she must make a DC 15
Constitution check or take 1d6 points of lethal damage each minute
thereafter until freed or dead.<br>
