					Enchantment (Charm) [Language Dependent, Mind-Affecting, Sonic]<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Brd 2, Clr 2<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 round<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br>
      <strong>Targets:</strong> Any number of creatures<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> 1 hour or less<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> Will negates; see text<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>

					<br>
If you have the attention of a group of creatures, you can use this
spell to hold them spellbound. To cast the spell, you must speak or
sing without interruption for 1 full round. Thereafter, those affected
give you their undivided attention, ignoring their surroundings. They
are considered to have an attitude of friendly while under the effect
of the spell. Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion
unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw.<br>
      <br>
A creature with 4 or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher
remains aware of its surroundings and has an attitude of indifferent.
It gains a new saving throw if it witnesses actions that it opposes.<br>
      <br>
The effect lasts as long as you speak or sing, to a maximum of 1 hour. Those <i>enthralled</i>
by your words take no action while you speak or sing and for 1d3 rounds
thereafter while they discuss the topic or performance. Those entering
the area during the performance must also successfully save or become <i>enthralled</i>. The speech ends (but the 1d3-round delay still applies) if you lose concentration or do anything other than speak or sing.<br>
      <br>
If those not <i>enthralled</i> have unfriendly or hostile attitudes
toward you, they can collectively make a Charisma check to try to end
the spell by jeering and heckling. For this check, use the Charisma
bonus of the creature with the highest Charisma in the group; others
may make Charisma checks to assist. The heckling ends the spell if this
check result beats your Charisma check result. Only one such challenge
is allowed per use of the spell.<br>
      <br>
If any member of the audience is attacked or subjected to some other overtly hostile act, the spell ends and the previously <i>enthralled</i>
members become immediately unfriendly toward you. Each creature with 4
or more HD or with a Wisdom score of 16 or higher becomes hostile.<br>
