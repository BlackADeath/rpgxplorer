					Necromancy<br>
      <strong>Level:</strong> Clr 9, Sor/Wiz 9, Travel 9<br>
      <strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M<br>
      <strong>Casting Time:</strong> 30 minutes<br>
      <strong>Range:</strong> Touch<br>
      <strong>Targets:</strong> You plus one additional willing creature touched per two caster levels<br>
      <strong>Duration:</strong> See text<br>
      <strong>Saving Throw:</strong> None<br>
      <strong>Spell Resistance:</strong> Yes<br>

					<br>
By freeing your spirit from your physical body, this spell allows you
to project an astral body onto another plane altogether.<br>
      <br>
You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you,
provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the
time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and
must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the
journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them.<br>
      <br>
You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your
physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended
animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or
carry onto the Astral Plane. Since the Astral Plane touches upon other
planes, you can travel astrally to any of these other planes as you
will. To enter one, you leave the Astral Plane, forming a new physical
body (and equipment) on the plane of existence you have chosen to enter.<br>
      <br>
While you are on the Astral Plane, your astral body is connected at all
times to your physical body by a silvery cord. If the cord is broken,
you are killed, astrally and physically. Luckily, very few things can
destroy a silver cord. When a second body is formed on a different
plane, the incorporeal silvery cord remains invisibly attached to the
new body. If the second body or the astral form is slain, the cord
simply returns to your body where it rests on the Material Plane,
thereby reviving it from its state of suspended animation. Although
astral projections are able to function on the Astral Plane, their
actions affect only creatures existing on the Astral Plane; a physical
body must be materialized on other planes.<br>
      <br>
You and your companions may travel through the Astral Plane
indefinitely. Your bodies simply wait behind in a state of suspended
animation until you choose to return your spirits to them. The spell
lasts until you desire to end it, or until it is terminated by some
outside means, such as <i>dispel magic</i> cast upon either the
physical body or the astral form, the breaking of the silver cord, or
the destruction of your body back on the Material Plane (which kills
you).<br>
      <br>
      <i>Material Component:</i> A jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected.
