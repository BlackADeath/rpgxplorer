The indicated amount is how much it costs to get a spellcaster to cast
a spell for you. This cost assumes that you can go to the spellcaster
and have the spell cast at his or her convenience (generally at least
24 hours later, so that the spellcaster has time to prepare the spell
in question). If you want to bring the spellcaster somewhere to cast a
spell you need to negotiate with him or her, and the default answer is
no.<br>


      <br>


The cost given is for a spell with no cost for a material component or
focus component and no XP cost. If the spell includes a material
component, add the cost of that component to the cost of the spell.<br>

      <br>


If the spell has a focus component (other than a divine focus), add
1/10 the cost of that focus to the cost of the spell. If the spell has
an XP cost, add 5 gp per XP lost. <br>


      <br>


Furthermore, if a spell has dangerous consequences, the spellcaster
will certainly require proof that you can and will pay for dealing with
any such consequences (that is, assuming that the spellcaster even
agrees to cast such a spell, which isn&rsquo;t certain). In the case of
spells that transport the caster and characters over a distance, you
will likely have to pay for two castings of the spell, even if you
aren&rsquo;t returning with the caster.<br>


      <br>


In addition, not every town or village has a spellcaster of sufficient
level to cast any spell. In general, you must travel to a small town
(or larger settlement) to be reasonably assured of finding a
spellcaster capable of casting 1st-level spells, a large town for
2nd-level spells, a small city for 3rd- or 4th-level spells, a large
city for 5th- or 6th-level spells, and a metropolis for 7th- or
8th-level spells. Even a metropolis isn&rsquo;t guaranteed to have a
local spellcaster able to cast 9th-level spells.
