level indicated on Table: The Psion Uncarnate, a psion uncarnate gains
additional power points per day and access to new powers as if he had
also gained a level in whatever manifesting class he belonged to before
he added the prestige class. He does not, however, gain any other
benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats,
metapsionic or item creation feats, psicrystal special abilities, and
so on). This essentially means that he adds the level of psion
uncarnate to the level of whatever manifesting class the character has,
then determines power points per day, powers known, and manifester
level accordingly.</p>
      <p>If a character had more than one manifesting class before he
became a psion uncarnate, he must decide to which class he adds the new
level of psion uncarnate for the purpose of determining power points
per day, powers known, and manifester level.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Incorporeal Touch (Su):</span>
Beginning at 1st level, a psion uncarnate can make up to three melee
touch attacks per day that each deal 1d6 points of damage if they hit.
The character&rsquo;s Strength modifier is not applied to this attack,
but it is effective against incorporeal creatures (and against
corporeal creatures while the psion uncarnate is incorporeal) The
character&rsquo;s hand and arm seem to become slightly translucent when
he makes these attacks. A miss still counts as a use of the ability.</p>
      <p>While uncarnate (see below), a psion uncarnate can make melee
touch attacks at will that do not count against his uses of this
ability.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>For every four levels higher than 1st the psion uncarnate attains, the damage on these attacks increases by 1d6 points.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncarnate Armor (Su):</span>
A psion uncarnate wearing armor (or using inertial armor or a similar
effect) gets his armor bonus to AC even when he becomes incorporeal
(see Shed Body, below). However, unlike other incorporeal creatures, a
psion uncarnate does not gain a deflection bonus to Armor Class from
his Charisma modifier. This ability works even if the armor being worn
becomes incorporeal (such as through the use of the assume equipment
ability described below).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Shed Body (Su):</span>
Starting at 2nd level, a psion uncarnate can become incorporeal (or
&ldquo;uncarnate&rdquo;) once per day as a standard action. The
character can remain uncarnate for up to 1 minute. During this time,
the character&rsquo;s body fades into an immaterial form that retains
the character&rsquo;s basic likeness. While uncarnate, the character
gains the incorporeal subtype (see below). He gains a fly speed equal
to his land speed (perfect maneuverability). His material armor remains
in place and continues to provide its armor bonus to AC (see Uncarnate
Armor, above). His material weapons also remain corporeal. Losing his
physical form allows the character to more easily access his mental
abilities, and he gains a +1 bonus on all save DCs for powers he
manifests while uncarnate.</p>
      <p>He can use equipment normally, deriving benefits from items
that enhance his capabilities; however, all his equipment remains
material even when the character is uncarnate (but see the assume
equipment ability, described below).&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Often, a psion uncarnate appears almost like a ghost wearing
items of the material world. This doesn&rsquo;t make his equipment more
susceptible to attack (the normal rules for attended objects apply),
but it does make it impossible for the character to enter or pass
through solid objects while wearing solid equipment. If he drops his
material equipment, he can pass through solid objects at will as
described below.</p>
      <p>At 6th level and higher, a psion uncarnate can shed his body twice per day for up to 1 minute each time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-style: italic;">Incorporeal Subtype:</span>
An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no physical body. He can be harmed
only by other incorporeal creatures, magic weapons or creatures that
strike as magic weapons, and spells, spell-like abilities, or
supernatural abilities. He is immune to all nonmagical attack forms.
Even when hit by spells or magic weapons, he has a 50% chance to ignore
any damage from a corporeal source (except for positive energy,
negative energy, force effects, or attacks made with ghost touch
weapons).</p>
      <p>An incorporeal psion uncarnate has no natural armor
bonus&mdash;and, unlike other incorporeal creatures, does not gain a
deflection bonus from his Charisma modifier. An incorporeal psion
uncarnate can enter or pass through solid objects (subject to the
restrictions described in the shed body and assume equipment
abilities), but must remain adjacent to the object&rsquo;s exterior,
and so cannot pass entirely through an object whose space is larger
than his own. He can sense the presence of creatures or objects within
a square adjacent to his current location, but enemies have total
concealment (50% miss chance) from an incorporeal psion uncarnate that
is inside an object. To see farther from the object he is in and attack
normally, the incorporeal psion uncarnate must emerge. An incorporeal
psion uncarnate inside an object has total cover, but when he attacks a
creature outside the object he only has cover, so a creature outside
with a readied action could strike at him as he attacks. An incorporeal
psion uncarnate cannot pass through a force effect.</p>
      <p>An incorporeal psion uncarnate&rsquo;s attacks pass through
(ignore) natural armor, armor, and shields, although deflection bonuses
and force effects work normally against him. He can pass through and
operate in water as easily as he does in air. An incorporeal psion
uncarnate cannot fall or take falling damage. He cannot make trip or
grapple attacks, nor can he be tripped or grappled. In fact, he cannot
take any physical action that would move or manipulate an opponent or
its equipment, nor is he subject to such actions.</p>
      <p>Incorporeal creatures have no weight and do not set off traps
that are triggered by weight. An incorporeal creature moves silently
and cannot be heard with Listen checks if it doesn&rsquo;t wish to be.
It has no Strength score, so its Dexterity modifier applies to both its
melee attack rolls and its ranged attack rolls. Nonvisual senses, such
as scent and blindsight, are either ineffective or only partly
effective with regard to incorporeal creatures. Incorporeal creatures
have an innate sense of direction and can move at full speed even when
they cannot see.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assume Equipment (Su):</span>
Beginning at 3rd level, a psion uncarnate can designate a number of
pieces of his worn equipment (including armor and weapons) equal to his
psion uncarnate level to become incorporeal when he uses his shed body
ability. This has no effect on the equipment&rsquo;s function, but now
when the psion uncarnate is incorporeal, he can enter or pass through
solid objects while wearing nothing other than the designated
equipment. Once designated, the equipment automatically changes to
incorporeal when the character sheds his body, and it returns to
corporeality when the character does. The character can change his
designations as he desires.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Assume Likeness (Su):</span>
At 4th level and higher, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can
assume the likeness of any Small, Medium, or Large creature as a
standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The
character&rsquo;s abilities do not change, but he appears to be the
creature that he assumes the likeness of, allowing him the ability to
effectively disguise himself and bluff those who might wonder at his
true nature. Each physical interaction with a creature requires a
successful Bluff check (opposed by the creature&rsquo;s Sense Motive
check) to convince the creature of the psion uncarnate&rsquo;s new
appearance. The psion uncarnate must not do anything to give away his
true (incorporeal) nature in order for the bluff to be successful; for
instance, if he accepts an item from another creature only to have it
fall through his immaterial hands, the Bluff check automatically fails.
However, a Bluff check would be allowed if the psion uncarnate uses his
telekinetic force ability (see below) to hold the received item.</p>
      <p>When using his assume likeness ability, a psion uncarnate has
an additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If he can read
an opponent&rsquo;s mind, he gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on
Bluff and Disguise checks.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Telekinetic Force (Su):</span>
Beginning at 7th level, while incorporeal, a psion uncarnate can use a
telekinetic force effect as a standard action that does not provoke
attacks of opportunity. The save DC is equal to 14 + the psion
uncarnate&rsquo;s key ability modifier (either Int, Wis, or Cha). The
character&rsquo;s manifester level is the manifester level of the
effect.<br>
Even while corporeal, a psion uncarnate can use this ability, but only
three times per day (uses while he is uncarnate do not count against
this use limit).</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncarnate Bridge (Su):</span>
At 8th level, as a creature of almost pure mind, a psion uncarnate
becomes more closely attuned to the minds of other creatures. He gains
the ability to transport himself via the minds of living creatures.
Once per day as a standard action while incorporeal, he can seamlessly
enter any living creature with an Intelligence score and pass to
another living creature with an Intelligence score that is within line
of sight of the first creature.</p>
      <p>The psion uncarnate must be in a space adjacent to the entry
creature before transporting, and he appears in a space adjacent to the
destination creature after transporting. The entry and destination
creatures need not be familiar to the character. A psion uncarnate
cannot use himself as the entry or destination creature. Neither
creature need be a willing participant.</p>
      <p>When exiting the destination creature, the psion uncarnate
chooses an adjacent square in which to appear. Entering and leaving a
creature is painless, unless the psion uncarnate wishes otherwise (see
below). In most cases, though, the destination creature finds being the
endpoint of a mental bridge surprising and quite unsettling.</p>
      <p>If he desires, a psion uncarnate can destructively exit the
destination creature. If the creature fails a Will save (DC 15 + psion
uncarnate&rsquo;s key ability modifier), the exiting psion uncarnate
tunes his mental form to destructively interfere with the
target&rsquo;s mind. He bursts forth explosively from the
creature&rsquo;s body, dealing it 10d6 points of damage.</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uncarnate (Ex):</span> At
10th level, a psion uncarnate becomes a being of pure psionic
consciousness. This ability is similar to shed body, except the
character is permanently incorporeal (and gains that subtype). If the
character desires, he can become corporeal once per day for up to 1
minute, but he spends the rest of his time as an entity of mind
untethered by the physical world.</p>
