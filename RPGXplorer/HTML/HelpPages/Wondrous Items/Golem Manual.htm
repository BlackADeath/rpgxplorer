				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">&nbsp;A golem manual contains
information, incantations and magical power that help a character to
craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on
skill checks made to craft the golem&rsquo;s body. Each manual also
holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem, effectively
grants the builder use of the Craft Construct feat during the
construction of the golem, and grants the character an increase to her
caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. Any golem built using
a golem manual does not cost the creator any XP, since the requisite XP
are &ldquo;contained&rdquo; in the book and &ldquo;expended&rdquo; by
the book during the creation process.<br>
      <br>
The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger
activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a
golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing
the golem&rsquo;s body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the
manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book&rsquo;s
ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.<br>
