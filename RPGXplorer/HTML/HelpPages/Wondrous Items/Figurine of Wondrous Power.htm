				<td class="HelpText" valign="top">&nbsp;Each of the several kinds of <span style="font-style: italic;">figurines of wondrous power</span>
appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high
(with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct
command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size
(except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its
owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but
does not speak.<br>
      <br>
If a <span style="font-style: italic;">figurine of wondrous power</span>
is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All
magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the
figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a
later time.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Bronze Griffon</span>: When animated, a <span style="font-style: italic;">bronze griffon</span>
acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its
possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per
use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the <span style="font-style: italic;">bronze griffon</span> once again becomes a tiny statuette.<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 10,000 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Ebony Fly</span>: When animated, an <span style="font-style: italic;">ebony fly</span>
is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a hippogriff but
can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up
to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word
is spoken, the <span style="font-style: italic;">ebony fly</span> again becomes a tiny statuette.<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 10,000 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Golden Lions</span>:
These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If
slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form
for one full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1
hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 16,500 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ivory Goats</span>: These
figurines come in threes. Each goat of this trio looks slightly
different from the others, and each has a different function:<br>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Goat of Traveling</span>:
This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a
heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a
maximum of one day each week&mdash;continuously or in any combination
of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word
is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for not less than one day
before it can again be used.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Goat of Travail</span>:
This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with
the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of
wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is
charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of
damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to
life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.</li>
        <li><span style="font-style: italic;">The Goat of Terror</span>:
When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a
destrier-like mount, with the statistics of a light warhorse. However,
its rider can employ the goat&rsquo;s horns as weapons (one horn as a
+3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack
against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a
30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every two
weeks for up to 3 hours per use.</li>
      </ul>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 21,000 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Marble Elephant</span>: This is
the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a
human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows
to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created
from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine&rsquo;s owner,
serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette
can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time.<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 17,000 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Obsidian Steed</span>: This
figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only
careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of
quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a
fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy warhorse with the following
additional powers usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane
shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if
the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to
carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form.
The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up
to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane
shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.<br>
Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.<br>
Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">etherealness</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">fly</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">plane shift</span>; Price 28,500 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Onyx Dog</span>: When commanded,
this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a
riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can
communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual
abilities. (It has the scent ability and adds +4 to its Spot and Search
checks.) It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility. An
onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its
owner.<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 15,500 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Serpentine Owl</span>: This
figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl
according to the command word used. The transformation can take place
once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However,
after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses
all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by
telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. (Remember the
limitations of its Intelligence.)<br>
Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 9,100 gp.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Silver Raven</span>: This silver
figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic
consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off
into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an
animal messenger spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven
obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or
telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only
24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous.<br>
Faint enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; Craft Wondrous Item, <span style="font-style: italic;">animal messenger</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">animate objects</span>; Price 3,800 gp.
